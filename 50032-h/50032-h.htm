<h2>A DOG OF FLANDERS<br />
<small>A STORY OF NOËL.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Nello</span> and Patrasche were left all alone in the
world.</p>

<p>They were friends in a friendship closer than brotherhood.
Nello was a little Ardennois—Patrasche was a
big Fleming. They were both of the same age by
length of years, yet one was still young, and the other
was already old. They had dwelt together almost all
their days: both were orphaned and destitute, and
owed their lives to the same hand. It had been the
beginning of the tie between them, their first bond of
sympathy; and it had strengthened day by day, and
had grown with their growth, firm and indissoluble,
until they loved one another very greatly.</p>

<p>Their home was a little hut on the edge of a little
village—a Flemish village a league from Antwerp, set
amidst flat breadths of pasture and corn-lands, with
long lines of poplars and of alders bending in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
breeze on the edge of the great canal which ran
through it. It had about a score of houses and homesteads,
with shutters of bright green or sky-blue, and
roofs rose-red or black and white, and walls white-washed
until they shone in the sun like snow. In
the centre of the village stood a windmill, placed on a
little moss-grown slope: it was a landmark to all the
level country round. It had once been painted scarlet,
sails and all, but that had been in its infancy, half a
century or more earlier, when it had ground wheat for
the soldiers of Napoleon; and it was now a ruddy
brown, tanned by wind and weather. It went queerly
by fits and starts, as though rheumatic and stiff in the
joints from age, but it served the whole neighborhood,
which would have thought it almost as impious to carry
grain elsewhere as to attend any other religious service
than the mass that was performed at the altar of the
little old gray church, with its conical steeple, which
stood opposite to it, and whose single bell rang morning,
noon, and night with that strange, subdued, hollow
sadness which every bell that hangs in the Low Countries
seems to gain as an integral part of its melody.</p>

<p>Within sound of the little melancholy clock almost
from their birth upward, they had dwelt together,
Nello and Patrasche, in the little hut on the edge of
the village, with the cathedral spire of Antwerp rising
in the north-east, beyond the great green plain of seeding
grass and spreading corn that stretched away from
them like a tideless, changeless sea. It was the hut
of a very old man, of a very poor man—of old Jehan
Daas who in his time had been a soldier, and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
remembered the wars that had trampled the country as
oxen tread down the furrows, and who had brought
from his service nothing except a wound, which had
made him a cripple.</p>

<p>When old Jehan Daas had reached his full eighty,
his daughter had died in the Ardennes, hard by Stavelot,
and had left him in legacy her two-year-old son.
The old man could ill contrive to support himself, but
he took up the additional burden uncomplainingly,
and it soon became welcome and precious to him.
Little Nello—which was but a pet diminutive for
Nicolas—throve with him, and the old man and the
little child lived in the poor little hut contentedly.</p>

<p>It was a very humble little mud-hut indeed, but it
was clean and white as a sea-shell, and stood in a small
plot of garden-ground that yielded beans and herbs
and pumpkins. They were very poor, terribly poor—many
a day they had nothing at all to eat. They
never by any chance had enough: to have had enough
to eat would have been to have reached paradise at
once. But the old man was very gentle and good to
the boy, and the boy was a beautiful, innocent, truthful,
tender-natured creature; and they were happy on
a crust and a few leaves of cabbage, and asked no
more of earth or heaven; save indeed that Patrasche
should be always with them, since without Patrasche
where would they have been?</p>

<p>For Patrasche was their alpha and omega; their
treasury and granary; their store of gold and wand
of wealth; their bread-winner and minister; their only
friend and comforter. Patrasche dead or gone from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
them, they must have laid themselves down and died
likewise. Patrasche was body, brains, hands, head, and
feet to both of them: Patrasche was their very life,
their very soul. For Jehan Daas was old and a cripple,
and Nello was but a child; and Patrasche was their
dog.</p>

<p>A dog of Flanders—yellow of hide, large of head
and limb, with wolf-like ears that stood erect, and legs
bowed and feet widened in the muscular development
wrought in his breed by many generations of hard
service. Patrasche came of a race which had toiled
hard and cruelly from sire to son in Flanders many a
century—slaves of slaves, dogs of the people, beasts
of the shafts and the harness, creatures that lived
straining their sinews in the gall of the cart, and died
breaking their hearts on the flints of the streets.</p>

<p>Patrasche had been born of parents who had labored
hard all their days over the sharp-set stones of the
various cities and the long, shadowless, weary roads
of the two Flanders and of Brabant. He had been
born to no other heritage than those of pain and of
toil. He had been fed on curses and baptized with
blows. Why not? It was a Christian country, and
Patrasche was but a dog. Before he was fully grown
he had known the bitter gall of the cart and the collar.
Before he had entered his thirteenth month he had
become the property of a hardware-dealer, who was
accustomed to wander over the land north and south,
from the blue sea to the green mountains. They sold
him for a small price, because he was so young.</p>

<p>This man was a drunkard and a brute. The life of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Patrasche was a life of hell. To deal the tortures of
hell on the animal creation is a way which the Christians
have of showing their belief in it. His purchaser
was a sullen, ill-living, brutal Brabantois, who heaped
his cart full with pots and pans and flagons and
buckets, and other wares of crockery and brass and
tin, and left Patrasche to draw the load as best he
might, whilst he himself lounged idly by the side in
fat and sluggish ease, smoking his black pipe and stopping
at every wineshop or café on the road.</p>

<p>Happily for Patrasche—or unhappily—he was very
strong: he came of an iron race, long born and bred
to such cruel travail; so that he did not die, but
managed to drag on a wretched existence under the
brutal burdens, the scarifying lashes, the hunger, the
thirst, the blows, the curses, and the exhaustion which
are the only wages with which the Flemings repay the
most patient and laborious of all their four-footed
victims. One day, after two years of this long and
deadly agony, Patrasche was going on as usual along
one of the straight, dusty, unlovely roads that lead to
the city of Rubens. It was full midsummer, and very
warm. His cart was very heavy, piled high with
goods in metal and in earthenware. His owner sauntered
on without noticing him otherwise than by the
crack of the whip as it curled round his quivering
loins. The Brabantois had paused to drink beer himself
at every wayside house, but he had forbidden
Patrasche to stop a moment for a draught from the
canal. Going along thus, in the full sun, on a scorching
highway, having eaten nothing for twenty-four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
hours, and, which was far worse to him, not having
tasted water for near twelve, being blind with dust,
sore with blows, and stupefied with the merciless weight
which dragged upon his loins, Patrasche, for once,
staggered and foamed a little at the mouth, and fell.</p>

<p>He fell in the middle of the white, dusty road, in
the full glare of the sun; he was sick unto death, and
motionless. His master gave him the only medicine
in his pharmacy—kicks and oaths and blows with a
cudgel of oak, which had been often the only food and
drink, the only wage and reward, ever offered to him.
But Patrasche was beyond the reach of any torture or
of any curses. Patrasche lay, dead to all appearances,
down in the white powder of the summer dust. After
a while, finding it useless to assail his ribs with punishment
and his ears with maledictions, the Brabantois—deeming
life gone in him, or going so nearly that his
carcass was forever useless, unless indeed some one
should strip it of the skin for gloves—cursed him
fiercely in farewell, struck off the leathern bands of the
harness, kicked his body heavily aside into the grass,
and, groaning and muttering in savage wrath, pushed
the cart lazily along the road up-hill, and left the
dying dog there for the ants to sting and for the crows
to pick.</p>

<p>It was the last day before Kermesse away at Louvain,
and the Brabantois was in haste to reach the fair
and get a good place for his truck of brass wares.
He was in fierce wrath, because Patrasche had been
a strong and much-enduring animal, and because he
himself had now the hard task of pushing his charette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
all the way to Louvain. But to stay to look after
Patrasche never entered his thoughts: the beast was
dying and useless, and he would steal, to replace him,
the first large dog that he found wandering alone out
of sight of its master. Patrasche had cost him nothing,
or next to nothing, and for two long, cruel years
had made him toil ceaselessly in his service from sunrise
to sunset, through summer and winter, in fair
weather and foul.</p>

<p>He had got a fair use and a good profit out of
Patrasche: being human, he was wise, and left the
dog to draw his last breath alone in the ditch, and
have his bloodshot eyes plucked out as they might be
by the birds, whilst he himself went on his way to beg
and to steal, to eat and to drink, to dance and to sing,
in the mirth at Louvain. A dying dog, a dog of the
cart—why should he waste hours over its agonies at
peril of losing a handful of copper coins, at peril of a
shout of laughter?</p>

<p>Patrasche lay there, flung in the grass-green ditch.
It was a busy road that day, and hundreds of people,
on foot and on mules, in wagons or in carts, went by,
tramping quickly and joyously on to Louvain. Some
saw him, most did not even look: all passed on. A
dead dog more or less—it was nothing in Brabant: it
would be nothing anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>After a time, among the holiday-makers, there came
a little old man who was bent and lame, and very
feeble. He was in no guise for feasting: he was very
poorly and miserably clad, and he dragged his silent
way slowly through the dust among the pleasure-seekers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
He looked at Patrasche, paused, wondered,
turned aside, then kneeled down in the rank grass and
weeds of the ditch, and surveyed the dog with kindly
eyes of pity. There was with him a little rosy, fair-haired,
dark-eyed child of a few years old, who pattered
in amidst the bushes, that were for him breast-high,
and stood gazing with a pretty seriousness upon
the poor, great, quiet beast.</p>

<p>Thus it was that these two first met—the little Nello
and the big Patrasche.</p>

<p>The upshot of that day was, that old Jehan Daas,
with much laborious effort, drew the sufferer homeward
to his own little hut, which was a stone’s throw off
amidst the fields, and there tended him with so much
care that the sickness, which had been a brain seizure,
brought on by heat and thirst and exhaustion, with
time and shade and rest passed away, and health and
strength returned, and Patrasche staggered up again
upon his four stout, tawny legs.</p>

<p>Now for many weeks he had been useless, powerless,
sore, near to death; but all this time he had heard no
rough word, had felt no harsh touch, but only the
pitying murmurs of the little child’s voice and the
soothing caress of the old man’s hand.</p>

<p>In his sickness they too had grown to care for him,
this lonely old man and the little happy child. He
had a corner of the hut, with a heap of dry grass for
his bed; and they had learned to listen eagerly for his
breathing in the dark night, to tell them that he lived;
and when he first was well enough to essay a loud,
hollow, broken bay, they laughed aloud, and almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
wept together for joy at such a sign of his sure restoration;
and little Nello, in delighted glee, hung
round his rugged neck with chains of marguerites, and
kissed him with fresh and ruddy lips.</p>

<p>So then, when Patrasche arose, himself again, strong,
big, gaunt, powerful, his great wistful eyes had a
gentle astonishment in them that there were no curses
to rouse him and no blows to drive him; and his heart
awakened to a mighty love, which never wavered once
in its fidelity whilst life abode with him.</p>

<p>But Patrasche, being a dog, was grateful. Patrasche
lay pondering long with grave, tender, musing brown
eyes, watching the movements of his friends.</p>

<p>Now, the old soldier, Jehan Daas, could do nothing
for his living but limp about a little with a small cart,
with which he carried daily the milk-cans of those
happier neighbors who owned cattle away into the
town of Antwerp. The villagers gave him the employment
a little out of charity—more because it suited
them well to send their milk into the town by so
honest a carrier, and bide at home themselves to look
after their gardens, their cows, their poultry, or their
little fields. But it was becoming hard work for the
old man. He was eighty-three, and Antwerp was a
good league off, or more.</p>

<p>Patrasche watched the milk-cans come and go that
one day when he had got well and was lying in the
sun with the wreath of marguerites round his tawny
neck.</p>

<p>The next morning, Patrasche, before the old man
had touched the cart, arose and walked to it and placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
himself betwixt its handles, and testified as plainly as
dumb show could do his desire and his ability to work
in return for the bread of charity that he had eaten.
Jehan Daas resisted long, for the old man was one of
those who thought it a foul shame to bind dogs to
labor for which Nature never formed them. But
Patrasche would not be gainsaid: finding they did
not harness him, he tried to draw the cart onward
with his teeth.</p>

<p>At length Jehan Daas gave way, vanquished by the
persistence and the gratitude of this creature whom he
had succored. He fashioned his cart so that Patrasche
could run in it, and this he did every morning of his
life thenceforward.</p>

<p>When the winter came, Jehan Daas thanked the
blessed fortune that had brought him to the dying dog
in the ditch that fair-day of Louvain; for he was very
old, and he grew feebler with each year, and he would
ill have known how to pull his load of milk-cans over
the snows and through the deep ruts in the mud if it
had not been for the strength and the industry of the
animal he had befriended. As for Patrasche, it seemed
heaven to him. After the frightful burdens that his
old master had compelled him to strain under, at the
call of the whip at every step, it seemed nothing to
him but amusement to step out with this little light
green cart, with its bright brass cans, by the side of
the gentle old man who always paid him with a tender
caress and with a kindly word. Besides, his work was
over by three or four in the day, and after that time
he was free to do as he would—to stretch himself, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
sleep in the sun, to wander in the fields, to romp with
the young child, or to play with his fellow-dogs.
Patrasche was very happy.</p>

<p>Fortunately for his peace, his former owner was
killed in a drunken brawl at the Kermesse of Mechlin,
and so sought not after him nor disturbed him in his
new and well-loved home.</p>

<p>A few years later, old Jehan Daas, who had always
been a cripple, became so paralyzed with rheumatism
that it was impossible for him to go out with the cart
any more. Then little Nello, being now grown to his
sixth year of age, and knowing the town well from
having accompanied his grandfather so many times,
took his place beside the cart, and sold the milk and
received the coins in exchange, and brought them back
to their respective owners with a pretty grace and
seriousness which charmed all who beheld him.</p>

<p>The little Ardennois was a beautiful child, with
dark, grave, tender eyes, and a lovely bloom upon his
face, and fair locks that clustered to his throat; and
many an artist sketched the group as it went by him—the
green cart with the brass flagons of Teniers and
Mieris and Van Tal, and the great tawny-colored,
massive dog, with his belled harness that chimed
cheerily as he went, and the small figure that ran beside
him which had little white feet in great wooden
shoes, and a soft, grave, innocent, happy face like the
little fair children of Rubens.</p>

<p>Nello and Patrasche did the work so well and so
joyfully together that Jehan Daas himself, when the
summer came and he was better again, had no need to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
stir out, but could sit in the doorway in the sun and
see them go forth through the garden wicket, and then
doze and dream and pray a little, and then awake
again as the clock tolled three and watch for their
return. And on their return Patrasche would shake
himself free of his harness with a bay of glee, and
Nello would recount with pride the doings of the day;
and they would all go in together to their meal of rye
bread and milk or soup, and would see the shadows
lengthen over the great plain, and see the twilight veil
the fair cathedral spire; and then lie down together to
sleep peacefully while the old man said a prayer.</p>

<p>So the days and the years went on, and the lives
of Nello and Patrasche were happy, innocent, and
healthful.</p>

<p>In the spring and summer especially were they glad.
Flanders is not a lovely land, and around the burgh of
Rubens it is perhaps least lovely of all. Corn and
colza, pasture and plough, succeed each other on the
characterless plain in wearying repetition, and save by
some gaunt gray tower, with its peal of pathetic bells,
or some figure coming athwart the fields, made picturesque
by a gleaner’s bundle or a woodman’s fagot,
there is no change, no variety, no beauty anywhere;
and he who has dwelt upon the mountains or amidst
the forests feels oppressed as by imprisonment with the
tedium and the endlessness of that vast and dreary
level. But it is green and very fertile, and it has
wide horizons that have a certain charm of their own
even in their dulness and monotony; and among the
rushes by the water-side the flowers grow, and the trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
rise tall and fresh where the barges glide with their
great hulks black against the sun, and their little green
barrels and vari-colored flags gay against the leaves.
Anyway, there is greenery and breadth of space enough
to be as good as beauty to a child and a dog; and these
two asked no better, when their work was done, than
to lie buried in the lush grasses on the side of the canal,
and watch the cumbrous vessels drifting by and bringing
the crisp salt smell of the sea among the blossoming
scents of the country summer.</p>

<p>True, in the winter it was harder, and they had to
rise in the darkness and the bitter cold, and they had
seldom as much as they could have eaten any day,
and the hut was scarce better than a shed when the
nights were cold, although it looked so pretty in warm
weather, buried in a great kindly-clambering vine, that
never bore fruit, indeed, but which covered it with
luxuriant green tracery all through the months of blossom
and harvest. In winter the winds found many
holes in the walls of the poor little hut, and the vine
was black and leafless, and the bare lands looked very
bleak and drear without, and sometimes within the floor
was flooded and then frozen. In winter it was hard, and
the snow numbed the little white limbs of Nello, and
the icicles cut the brave, untiring feet of Patrasche.</p>

<p>But even then they were never heard to lament,
either of them. The child’s wooden shoes and the
dog’s four legs would trot manfully together over the
frozen fields to the chime of the bells on the harness;
and then sometimes, in the streets of Antwerp, some
housewife would bring them a bowl of soup and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
handful of bread, or some kindly trader would throw
some billets of fuel into the little cart as it went homeward,
or some woman in their own village would bid
them keep some share of the milk they carried for their
own food; and then they would run over the white
lands, through the early darkness, bright and happy,
and burst with a shout of joy into their home.</p>

<p>So, on the whole, it was well with them, very well;
and Patrasche, meeting on the highway or in the public
streets the many dogs who toiled from daybreak into
nightfall, paid only with blows and curses, and loosened
from the shafts with a kick to starve and freeze as best
they might—Patrasche in his heart was very grateful
to his fate, and thought it the fairest and the kindliest
the world could hold. Though he was often very
hungry indeed when he lay down at night; though he
had to work in the heats of summer noons and the
rasping chills of winter dawns; though his feet were
often tender with wounds from the sharp edges of
the jagged pavement; though he had to perform tasks
beyond his strength and against his nature—yet he
was grateful and content: he did his duty with each
day, and the eyes that he loved smiled down on him.
It was sufficient for Patrasche.</p>

<p>There was only one thing which caused Patrasche
any uneasiness in his life, and it was this. Antwerp,
as all the world knows, is full at every turn of old piles
of stones dark and ancient and majestic, standing in
crooked courts, jammed against gateways and taverns,
rising by the water’s edge, with bells ringing above
them in the air, and ever and again out of their arched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
doors a swell of music pealing. There they remain,
the grand old sanctuaries of the past, shut in amidst
the squalor, the hurry, the crowds, the unloveliness, and
the commerce of the modern world, and all day long
the clouds drift and the birds circle and the winds sigh
around them, and beneath the earth at their feet there
sleeps—<span class="smcap">Rubens</span>.</p>

<p>And the greatness of the mighty Master still rests
upon Antwerp, and wherever we turn in its narrow
streets his glory lies therein, so that all mean things are
thereby transfigured; and as we pace slowly through
the winding ways, and by the edge of the stagnant
water, and through the noisome courts, his spirit abides
with us, and the heroic beauty of his visions is about
us, and the stones that once felt his footsteps and bore
his shadow seem to arise and speak of him with living
voices. For the city which is the tomb of Rubens still
lives to us through him, and him alone.</p>

<p>It is so quiet there by that great white sepulchre—so
quiet, save only when the organ peals and the choir
cries aloud the Salve Regina or the Kyrie Eleison.
Sure no artist ever had a greater gravestone than that
pure marble sanctuary gives to him in the heart of his
birthplace in the chancel of St. Jacques.</p>

<p>Without Rubens, what were Antwerp? A dirty,
dusky, bustling mart, which no man would ever care
to look upon save the traders who do business on its
wharves. With Rubens, to the whole world of men
it is a sacred name, a sacred soil, a Bethlehem where a
god of Art saw light, a Golgotha where a god of Art
lies dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>O nations! closely should you treasure your great
men, for by them alone will the future know of you.
Flanders in her generations has been wise. In his life
she glorified this greatest of her sons, and in his death
she magnifies his name. But her wisdom is very rare.</p>

<p>Now, the trouble of Patrasche was this. Into these
great, sad piles of stones, that reared their melancholy
majesty above the crowded roofs, the child Nello would
many and many a time enter, and disappear through
their dark arched portals, whilst Patrasche, left without
upon the pavement, would wearily and vainly ponder
on what could be the charm which thus allured from
him his inseparable and beloved companion. Once or
twice he did essay to see for himself, clattering up the
steps with his milk-cart behind him; but thereon he
had been always sent back again summarily by a tall
custodian in black clothes and silver chains of office;
and fearful of bringing his little master into trouble,
he desisted, and remained couched patiently before the
churches until such time as the boy reappeared. It
was not the fact of his going into them which disturbed
Patrasche: he knew that people went to church: all
the village went to the small, tumbledown, gray pile
opposite the red windmill. What troubled him was
that little Nello always looked strangely when he came
out, always very flushed or very pale; and whenever he
returned home after such visitations would sit silent
and dreaming, not caring to play, but gazing out at the
evening skies beyond the line of the canal, very subdued
and almost sad.</p>

<p>What was it? wondered Patrasche. He thought it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
could not be good or natural for the little lad to be so
grave, and in his dumb fashion he tried all he could to
keep Nello by him in the sunny fields or in the busy
market-place. But to the churches Nello would go:
most often of all would he go to the great cathedral;
and Patrasche, left without on the stones by the iron
fragments of Quentin Matsys’s gate, would stretch himself
and yawn and sigh, and even howl now and then,
all in vain, until the doors closed and the child perforce
came forth again, and winding his arms about the dog’s
neck would kiss him on his broad, tawny-colored forehead,
and murmur always the same words: “If I could
only see them, Patrasche!—if I could only see them!”</p>

<p>What were they? pondered Patrasche, looking up
with large, wistful, sympathetic eyes.</p>

<p>One day, when the custodian was out of the way and
the doors left ajar, he got in for a moment after his little
friend and saw. “They” were two great covered pictures
on either side of the choir.</p>

<p>Nello was kneeling, rapt as in an ecstasy, before the
altar-picture of the Assumption, and when he noticed
Patrasche, and rose and drew the dog gently out into
the air, his face was wet with tears, and he looked up
at the veiled places as he passed them, and murmured
to his companion, “It is so terrible not to see them,
Patrasche, just because one is poor and cannot pay!
He never meant that the poor should not see them when
he painted them, I am sure. He would have had us see
them any day, every day: that I am sure. And they
keep them shrouded there—shrouded in the dark, the
beautiful things!—and they never feel the light, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
no eyes look on them, unless rich people come and pay.
If I could only see them, I would be content to die.”</p>

<p>But he could not see them, and Patrasche could not
help him, for to gain the silver piece that the church
exacts as the price for looking on the glories of the
Elevation of the Cross and the Descent of the Cross
was a thing as utterly beyond the powers of either of
them as it would have been to scale the heights of the
cathedral spire. They had never so much as a sou to
spare: if they cleared enough to get a little wood for
the stove, a little broth for the pot, it was the utmost
they could do. And yet the heart of the child was set
in sore and endless longing upon beholding the greatness
of the two veiled Rubens.</p>

<p>The whole soul of the little Ardennois thrilled and
stirred with an absorbing passion for Art. Going on
his ways through the old city in the early days before
the sun or the people had risen, Nello, who looked only
a little peasant-boy, with a great dog drawing milk to
sell from door to door, was in a heaven of dreams
whereof Rubens was the god. Nello, cold and hungry,
with stockingless feet in wooden shoes, and the winter
winds blowing among his curls and lifting his poor
thin garments, was in a rapture of meditation, wherein
all that he saw was the beautiful fair face of the Mary
of the Assumption, with the waves of her golden hair
lying upon her shoulders, and the light of an eternal
sun shining down upon her brow. Nello, reared in
poverty, and buffeted by fortune, and untaught in
letters and unheeded by men, had the compensation of
the curse which is called Genius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>No one knew it. He as little as any. No one knew it.
Only indeed Patrasche, who, being with him always,
saw him draw with chalk upon the stones any and
every thing that grew or breathed, heard him on his
little bed of hay murmur all manner of timid, pathetic
prayers to the spirit of the great Master; watched his
gaze darken and his face radiate at the evening glow
of sunset or the rosy rising of the dawn; and felt many
and many a time the tears of a strange, nameless pain
and joy, mingled together, fall hotly from the bright
young eyes upon his own wrinkled yellow forehead.</p>

<p>“I should go to my grave quite content if I thought,
Nello, that when thou growest a man thou couldst own
this hut and the little plot of ground, and labor for
thyself, and be called Baas by thy neighbors,” said the
old man Jehan many an hour from his bed. For to
own a bit of soil, and to be called Baas—master—by
the hamlet round, is to have achieved the highest ideal
of a Flemish peasant; and the old soldier, who had
wandered over all the earth in his youth, and had
brought nothing back, deemed in his old age that to
live and die on one spot in contented humility was the
fairest fate he could desire for his darling. But Nello
said nothing.</p>

<p>The same leaven was working in him that in other
times begat Rubens and Jordaens and the Van Eycks,
and all their wondrous tribe, and in times more recent
begat in the green country of the Ardennes, where the
Meuse washes the old walls of Dijon, the great artist
of the Patroclus, whose genius is too near us for us
aright to measure its divinity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Nello dreamed of other things in the future than of
tilling the little rood of earth, and living under the
wattle roof, and being called Baas by neighbors a little
poorer or a little less poor than himself. The cathedral
spire, where it rose beyond the fields in the ruddy
evening skies or in the dim, gray, misty mornings, said
other things to him than this. But these he told only
to Patrasche, whispering, childlike, his fancies in the
dog’s ear when they went together at their work
through the fogs of the daybreak, or lay together at
their rest among the rustling rushes by the water’s
side.</p>

<p>For such dreams are not easily shaped into speech
to awake the slow sympathies of human auditors; and
they would only have sorely perplexed and troubled
the poor old man bedridden in his corner, who, for his
part, whenever he had trodden the streets of Antwerp,
had thought the daub of blue and red that they called
a Madonna, on the walls of the wine-shop where he
drank his sou’s worth of black beer, quite as good as
any of the famous altar-pieces for which the stranger
folk travelled far and wide into Flanders from every
land on which the good sun shone.</p>

<p>There was only one other beside Patrasche to whom
Nello could talk at all of his daring fantasies. This
other was little Alois, who lived at the old red mill on
the grassy mound, and whose father, the miller, was
the best-to-do husbandman in all the village. Little
Alois was only a pretty baby with soft round, rosy
features, made lovely by those sweet dark eyes that the
Spanish rule has left in so many a Flemish face, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
testimony of the Alvan dominion, as Spanish art has
left broadsown throughout the country majestic palaces
and stately courts, gilded house-fronts and sculptured
lintels—histories in blazonry and poems in stone.</p>

<div class="caption">NELLO DREW THEIR LIKENESS WITH A STICK OF CHARCOAL</div>
</div>

<p>Little Alois was often with Nello and Patrasche.
They played in the fields, they ran in the snow, they
gathered the daisies and bilberries, they went up to the
old gray church together, and they often sat together
by the broad wood-fire in the mill-house. Little Alois,
indeed, was the richest child in the hamlet. She had
neither brother nor sister; her blue serge dress had
never a hole in it; at Kermesse she had as many gilded
nuts and Agni Dei in sugar as her hands could hold;
and when she went up for her first communion her
flaxen curls were covered with a cap of richest Mechlin
lace, which had been her mother’s and her grandmother’s
before it came to her. Men spoke already,
though she had but twelve years, of the good wife she
would be for their sons to woo and win; but she herself
was a little gay, simple child, in nowise conscious
of her heritage, and she loved no playfellows so well
as Jehan Daas’s grandson and his dog.</p>

<p>One day her father, Baas Cogez, a good man, but
somewhat stern, came on a pretty group in the long
meadow behind the mill, where the aftermath had that
day been cut. It was his little daughter sitting amidst
the hay, with the great tawny head of Patrasche on
her lap, and many wreaths of poppies and blue cornflowers
round them both: on a clean smooth slab of
pine wood the boy Nello drew their likeness with a
stick of charcoal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The miller stood and looked at the portrait with
tears in his eyes, it was so strangely like, and he loved
his only child closely and well. Then he roughly chid
the little girl for idling there whilst her mother needed
her within, and sent her indoors crying and afraid:
then, turning, he snatched the wood from Nello’s hands.
“Dost do much of such folly?” he asked, but there
was a tremble in his voice.</p>

<p>Nello colored and hung his head. “I draw everything
I see,” he murmured.</p>

<p>The miller was silent: then he stretched his hand
out with a franc in it. “It is folly, as I say, and evil
waste of time: nevertheless, it is like Alois, and will
please the house-mother. Take this silver bit for it
and leave it for me.”</p>

<p>The color died out of the face of the young Ardennois;
he lifted his head and put his hands behind his
back. “Keep your money and the portrait both, Baas
Cogez,” he said, simply. “You have been often good
to me.” Then he called Patrasche to him, and walked
away across the field.</p>

<p>“I could have seen them with that franc,” he murmured
to Patrasche, “but I could not sell her picture—not
even for them.”</p>

<p>Bass Cogez went into his mill-house sore troubled in
his mind. “That lad must not be so much with Alois,”
he said to his wife that night. “Trouble may come
of it hereafter: he is fifteen now, and she is twelve;
and the boy is comely of face and form.”</p>

<p>“And he is a good lad and a loyal,” said the housewife
feasting her eyes on the piece of pine wood where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
it was throned above the chimney with a cuckoo clock
in oak and a Calvary in wax.</p>

<p>“Yea, I do not gainsay that,” said the miller, draining
his pewter flagon.</p>

<p>“Then, if what you think of were ever to come to
pass,” said the wife, hesitatingly, “would it matter so
much? She will have enough for both, and one cannot
be better than happy.”</p>

<p>“You are a woman, and therefore a fool,” said the
miller, harshly, striking his pipe on the table. “The
lad is naught but a beggar, and, with these painter’s
fancies, worse than a beggar. Have a care that they
are not together in the future, or I will send the child
to the surer keeping of the nuns of the Sacred Heart.”</p>

<p>The poor mother was terrified, and promised humbly
to do his will. Not that she could bring herself altogether
to separate the child from her favorite playmate,
nor did the miller even desire that extreme of cruelty
to a young lad who was guilty of nothing except poverty.
But there were many ways in which little Alois
was kept away from her chosen companion; and Nello,
being a boy proud and quiet and sensitive, was quickly
wounded, and ceased to turn his own steps and those of
Patrasche, as he had been used to do with every moment
of leisure, to the old red mill upon the slope.
What his offence was he did not know: he supposed
he had in some manner angered Baas Cogez by taking
the portrait of Alois in the meadow; and when the
child who loved him would run to him and nestle her
hand in his, he would smile at her very sadly and
say with a tender concern for her before himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>,
“Nay, Alois, do not anger your father. He thinks
that I make you idle, dear, and he is not pleased that
you should be with me. He is a good man and loves
you well: we will not anger him, Alois.”</p>

<p>But it was with a sad heart that he said it, and the
earth did not look so bright to him as it had used to do
when he went out at sunrise under the poplars down
the straight roads with Patrasche. The old red mill
had been a landmark to him, and he had been used to
pause by it, going and coming, for a cheery greeting
with its people as her little flaxen head rose above the
low mill-wicket, and her little rosy hands had held out
a bone or a crust to Patrasche. Now the dog looked
wistfully at a closed door, and the boy went on without
pausing, with a pang at his heart, and the child sat
within with tears dropping slowly on the knitting to
which she was set on her little stool by the stove; and
Baas Cogez, working among his sacks and his mill-gear,
would harden his will and say to himself, “It is best
so. The lad is all but a beggar, and full of idle,
dreaming fooleries. Who knows what mischief might
not come of it in the future?” So he was wise in his
generation, and would not have the door unbarred,
except upon rare and formal occasions, which seemed
to have neither warmth nor mirth in them to the two
children, who had been accustomed so long to a daily
gleeful, careless, happy interchange of greeting, speech,
and pastime, with no other watcher of their sports or
auditor of their fancies than Patrasche, sagely shaking
the brazen bells of his collar and responding with all
a dog’s swift sympathies to their every change of mood</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>All this while the little panel of pine wood remained
over the chimney in the mill-kitchen with the cuckoo
clock and the waxen Calvary, and sometimes it seemed
to Nello a little hard that whilst his gift was accepted
he himself should be denied.</p>

<p>But he did not complain: it was his habit to be
quiet: old Jehan Daas had said ever to him, “We are
poor: we must take what God sends—the ill with the
good: the poor cannot choose.”</p>

<p>To which the boy had always listened in silence, being
reverent of his old grandfather; but nevertheless
a certain vague, sweet hope, such as beguiles the children
of genius, had whispered in his heart, “Yet the
poor do choose sometimes—choose to be great, so that
men cannot say them nay.” And he thought so still
in his innocence; and one day, when the little Alois,
finding him by chance alone among the cornfields by the
canal, ran to him and held him close, and sobbed piteously
because the morrow would be her saint’s day, and
for the first time in all her life her parents had failed
to bid him to the little supper and romp in the great
barns with which her feast-day was always celebrated,
Nello had kissed her and murmured to her in firm
faith, “It shall be different one day, Alois. One day
that little bit of pine wood that your father has of mine
shall be worth its weight in silver; and he will not shut
the door against me then. Only love me always, dear
little Alois, only love me always, and I will be great.”</p>

<p>“And if I do not love you?” the pretty child asked,
pouting a little through her tears, and moved by the
instinctive coquetries of her sex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Nello’s eyes left her face and wandered to the distance,
where in the red and gold of the Flemish night
the cathedral spire rose. There was a smile on his face
so sweet and yet so sad that little Alois was awed by it.
“I will be great still,” he said under his breath—“great
still, or die, Alois.”</p>

<p>“You do not love me,” said the little spoilt child,
pushing him away; but the boy shook his head and
smiled, and went on his way through the tall yellow
corn, seeing as in a vision some day in a fair future when
he should come into that old familiar land and ask
Alois of her people, and be not refused or denied, but
received in honor, whilst the village folk should throng
to look upon him and say in one another’s ears, “Dost
see him? He is a king among men, for he is a great
artist and the world speaks his name; and yet he was
only our poor little Nello, who was a beggar, as one
may say, and only got his bread by the help of his dog.”
And he thought how he would fold his grandsire in
furs and purples, and portray him as the old man is
portrayed in the Family in the chapel of St. Jacques;
and of how he would hang the throat of Patrasche with
a collar of gold, and place him on his right hand, and
say to the people, “This was once my only friend;”
and of how he would build himself a great white marble
palace, and make to himself luxuriant gardens of
pleasure, on the slope looking outward to where the
cathedral spire rose, and not dwell in it himself, but
summon to it, as to a home, all men young and poor
and friendless, but of the will to do mighty things; and
of how he would say to them always, if they sought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
bless his name, “Nay, do not thank me—thank Rubens.
Without him, what should I have been?” And these
dreams, beautiful, impossible, innocent, free of all selfishness,
full of heroical worship, were so closely about
him as he went that he was happy—happy even on
this sad anniversary of Alois’s saint’s day, when he
and Patrasche went home by themselves to the little
dark hut and the meal of black bread, whilst in the
mill-house all the children of the village sang and
laughed, and ate the big round cakes of Dijon and the
almond gingerbread of Brabant, and danced in the
great barn to the light of the stars and the music of
flute and fiddle.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Patrasche,” he said, with his arms
round the dog’s neck as they both sat in the door of
the hut, where the sounds of the mirth at the mill came
down to them on the night air—“never mind. It shall
all be changed by and by.”</p>

<p>He believed in the future: Patrasche, of more experience
and of more philosophy, thought that the loss
of the mill supper in the present was ill compensated by
dreams of milk and honey in some vague hereafter. And
Patrasche growled whenever he passed by Baas Cogez.</p>

<p>“This is Alois’s name-day, is it not?” said the old
man Daas that night from the corner where he was
stretched upon his bed of sacking.</p>

<p>The boy gave a gesture of assent: he wished that
the old man’s memory had erred a little, instead of
keeping such sure account.</p>

<p>“And why not there?” his grandfather pursued
“Thou hast never missed a year before, Nello.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thou art too sick to leave,” murmured the lad,
bending his handsome young head over the bed.</p>

<p>“Tut! tut! Mother Nulette would have come and
sat with me, as she does scores of times. What is the
cause, Nello?” the old man persisted. “Thou surely
hast not had ill words with the little one?”</p>

<p>“Nay, grandfather—never,” said the boy quickly,
with a hot color in his bent face. “Simply and truly,
Baas Cogez did not have me asked this year. He has
taken some whim against me.”</p>

<p>“But thou hast done nothing wrong?”</p>

<p>“That I know—nothing. I took the portrait of
Alois on a piece of pine: that is all.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” The old man was silent: the truth suggested
itself to him with the boy’s innocent answer. He was
tied to a bed of dried leaves in the corner of a wattle
hut, but he had not wholly forgotten what the ways of
the world were like.</p>

<p>He drew Nello’s fair head fondly to his breast with
a tenderer gesture. “Thou art very poor, my child,”
he said with a quiver the more in his aged, trembling
voice—“so poor! It is very hard for thee.”</p>

<p>“Nay, I am rich,” murmured Nello; and in his
innocence he thought so—rich with the imperishable
powers that are mightier than the might of kings. And
he went and stood by the door of the hut in the quiet
autumn night, and watched the stars troop by and the
tall poplars bend and shiver in the wind. All the
casements of the mill-house were lighted, and every
now and then the notes of the flute came to him. The
tears fell down his cheeks, for he was but a child, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
he smiled, for he said to himself, “In the future!” He
stayed there until all was quite still and dark, then he
and Patrasche went within and slept together, long and
deeply, side by side.</p>

<p>Now he had a secret which only Patrasche knew.
There was a little out-house to the hut, which no one
entered but himself—a dreary place, but with abundant
clear light from the north. Here he had fashioned
himself rudely an easel in rough lumber, and here on
a great gray sea of stretched paper he had given shape
to one of the innumerable fancies which possessed his
brain. No one had ever taught him anything; colors
he had no means to buy; he had gone without bread
many a time to procure even the few rude vehicles that
he had here; and it was only in black or white that he
could fashion the things he saw. This great figure
which he had drawn here in chalk was only an old man
sitting on a fallen tree—only that. He had seen old
Michel the woodman sitting so at evening many a time.
He had never had a soul to tell him of outline or
perspective, of anatomy or of shadow, and yet he had
given all the weary, worn-out age, all the sad, quiet
patience, all the rugged, careworn pathos of his original,
and given them so that the old lonely figure was
a poem, sitting there, meditative and alone, on the dead
tree, with the darkness of the descending night behind
him.</p>

<p>It was rude, of course, in a way, and had many
faults, no doubt; and yet it was real, true in nature,
true in art and very mournful, and in a manner
beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Patrasche had lain quiet countless hours watching
its gradual creation after the labor of each day was
done, and he knew that Nello had a hope—vain and
wild perhaps, but strongly cherished—of sending this
great drawing to compete for a prize of two hundred
francs a year which it was announced in Antwerp would
be open to every lad of talent, scholar or peasant,
under eighteen, who would attempt to win it with some
unaided work of chalk or pencil. Three of the foremost
artists in the town of Rubens were to be the
judges and elect the victor according to his merits.</p>

<p>All the spring and summer and autumn Nello had
been at work upon this treasure, which, if triumphant,
would build him his first step toward independence
and the mysteries of the art which he blindly,
ignorantly, and yet passionately adored.</p>

<p>He said nothing to any one: his grandfather would
not have understood, and little Alois was lost to him.
Only to Patrasche he told all, and whispered, “Rubens
would give it me, I think, if he knew.”</p>

<p>Patrasche thought so too, for he knew that Rubens
had loved dogs or he had never painted them with such
exquisite fidelity; and men who loved dogs were, as
Patrasche knew, always pitiful.</p>

<p>The drawings were to go in on the first day of
December, and the decision be given on the twenty-fourth,
so that he who should win might rejoice with
all his people at the Christmas season.</p>

<p>In the twilight of a bitter wintry day, and with a
beating heart, now quick with hope, now faint with
fear Nello placed the great picture on his little green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
milk-cart, and took it, with the help of Patrasche, into
the town, and there left it, as enjoined, at the doors of
a public building.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is worth nothing at all. How can I
tell?” he thought, with the heart-sickness of a great
timidity. Now that he had left it there, it seemed to
him so hazardous, so vain, so foolish, to dream that he,
a little lad with bare feet, who barely knew his letters,
could do anything at which great painters, real artists,
could ever deign to look. Yet he took heart as he
went by the cathedral: the lordly form of Rubens
seemed to rise from the fog and the darkness, and to
loom in its magnificence before him, whilst the lips,
with their kindly smile, seemed to him to murmur,
“Nay, have courage! It was not by a weak heart and
by faint fears that I wrote my name for all time upon
Antwerp.”</p>

<p>Nello ran home through the cold night, comforted.
He had done his best: the rest must be as God willed,
he thought, in that innocent, unquestioning faith which
had been taught him in the little gray chapel among
the willows and the poplar-trees.</p>

<p>The winter was very sharp already. That night,
after they reached the hut, snow fell; and fell for very
many days after that, so that the paths and the divisions
in the fields were all obliterated, and all the smaller
streams were frozen over, and the cold was intense
upon the plains. Then, indeed, it became hard work
to go round for the milk while the world was all dark,
and carry it through the darkness to the silent town.
Hard work, especially for Patrasche, for the passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of the years, that were only bringing Nello a stronger
youth, were bringing him old age, and his joints were
stiff and his bones ached often. But he would never
give up his share of the labor. Nello would fain have
spared him and drawn the cart himself, but Patrasche
would not allow it. All he would ever permit or accept
was the help of a thrust from behind to the truck
as it lumbered along through the ice-ruts. Patrasche
had lived in harness, and he was proud of it. He
suffered a great deal sometimes from frost, and the
terrible roads, and the rheumatic pains of his limbs,
but he only drew his breath hard and bent his stout
neck, and trod onward with steady patience.</p>

<p>“Rest thee at home, Patrasche—it is time thou didst
rest—and I can quite well push in the cart by myself,”
urged Nello many a morning; but Patrasche, who
understood him aright, would no more have consented
to stay at home than a veteran soldier to shirk when
the charge was sounding; and every day he would rise
and place himself in his shafts, and plod along over
the snow through the fields that his four round feet had
left their print upon so many, many years.</p>

<p>“One must never rest till one dies,” thought Patrasche;
and sometimes it seemed to him that that time
of rest for him was not very far off. His sight was less
clear than it had been, and it gave him pain to rise
after the night’s sleep, though he would never lie a
moment in his straw when once the bell of the chapel
tolling five let him know that the daybreak of labor
had begun.</p>

<p>“My poor Patrasche, we shall soon lie quiet together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
you and I,” said old Jehan Daas, stretching out to
stroke the head of Patrasche with the old withered
hand which had always shared with him its one poor
crust of bread; and the hearts of the old man and the
old dog ached together with one thought: When they
were gone, who would care for their darling?</p>

<p>One afternoon, as they came back from Antwerp over
the snow, which had become hard and smooth as marble
over all the Flemish plains, they found dropped in
the road a pretty little puppet, a tambourine-player,
all scarlet and gold, about six inches high, and, unlike
greater personages when Fortune lets them drop, quite
unspoiled and unhurt by its fall. It was a pretty toy.
Nello tried to find its owner, and, failing, thought that
it was just the thing to please Alois.</p>

<p>It was quite night when he passed the mill-house:
he knew the little window of her room. It could be
no harm, he thought, if he gave her his little piece
of treasure-trove, they had been playfellows so long.
There was a shed with a sloping roof beneath her casement:
he climbed it and tapped softly at the lattice:
there was a little light within. The child opened it
and looked out half frightened.</p>

<p>Nello put the tambourine-player into her hands.
“Here is a doll I found in the snow, Alois. Take it,”
he whispered—“take it, and God bless thee, dear!”</p>

<p>He slid down from the shed-roof before she had time
to thank him, and ran off through the darkness.</p>

<p>That night there was a fire at the mill. Out-buildings
and much corn were destroyed, although the mill
itself and the dwelling-house were unharmed. All the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
village was out in terror, and engines came tearing
through the snow from Antwerp. The miller was
insured, and would lose nothing: nevertheless, he was
in furious wrath, and declared aloud that the fire was
due to no accident, but to some foul intent.</p>

<p>Nello, awakened from his sleep, ran to help with the
rest: Baas Cogez thrust him angrily aside. “Thou
wert loitering here after dark,” he said roughly. “I
believe, on my soul, that thou dost know more of the
fire than any one.”</p>

<p>Nello heard him in silence, stupefied, not supposing
that any one could say such things except in jest, and
not comprehending how any one could pass a jest at
such a time.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the miller said the brutal thing openly
to many of his neighbors in the day that followed; and
though no serious charge was ever preferred against the
lad, it got bruited about that Nello had been seen in
the mill-yard after dark on some unspoken errand, and
that he bore Baas Cogez a grudge for forbidding his
intercourse with little Alois; and so the hamlet, which
followed the sayings of its richest landowner servilely,
and whose families all hoped to secure the riches of
Alois in some future time for their sons, took the hint
to give grave looks and cold words to old Jehan Daas’s
grandson. No one said anything to him openly, but
all the village agreed together to humor the miller’s
prejudice, and at the cottages and farms where Nello
and Patrasche called every morning for the milk for
Antwerp, downcast glances and brief phrases replaced
to them the broad smiles and cheerful greetings to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
which they had been always used. No one really credited
the miller’s absurd suspicion, nor the outrageous
accusations born of them, but the people were all very
poor and very ignorant, and the one rich man of the
place had pronounced against him. Nello, in his innocence
and his friendlessness, had no strength to stem
the popular tide.</p>

<p>“Thou art very cruel to the lad,” the miller’s wife
dared to say, weeping, to her lord. “Sure he is an innocent
lad and a faithful, and would never dream of
any such wickedness, however sore his heart might be.”</p>

<p>But Baas Cogez being an obstinate man, having once
said a thing held to it doggedly, though in his innermost
soul he knew well the injustice that he was committing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Nello endured the injury done against
him with a certain proud patience that disdained to
complain: he only gave way a little when he was quite
alone with old Patrasche. Besides, he thought, “If it
should win! They will be sorry then, perhaps.”</p>

<p>Still, to a boy not quite sixteen, and who had dwelt
in one little world all his short life, and in his childhood
had been caressed and applauded on all sides, it
was a hard trial to have the whole of that little world
turn against him for naught. Especially hard in that
bleak, snow-bound, famine-stricken winter-time, when
the only light and warmth there could be found abode
beside the village hearths and in the kindly greetings
of neighbors. In the winter-time all drew nearer to
each other, all to all, except to Nello and Patrasche,
with whom none now would have anything to do, and
who were left to fare as they might with the old paralyzed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
bedridden man in the little cabin, whose fire was
often low, and whose board was often without bread,
for there was a buyer from Antwerp who had taken to
drive his mule in of a day for the milk of the various
dairies, and there were only three or four of the
people who had refused his terms of purchase and remained
faithful to the little green cart. So that the
burden which Patrasche drew had become very light,
and the centime-pieces in Nello’s pouch had become,
alas! very small likewise.</p>

<p>The dog would stop, as usual, at all the familiar
gates which were now closed to him, and look up at
them with wistful, mute appeal; and it cost the neighbors
a pang to shut their doors and their hearts, and let
Patrasche draw his cart on again, empty. Nevertheless,
they did it, for they desired to please Baas Cogez.</p>

<p>Noël was close at hand.</p>

<p>The weather was very wild and cold. The snow
was six feet deep, and the ice was firm enough to bear
oxen and men upon it everywhere. At this season the
little village was always gay and cheerful. At the
poorest dwelling there were possets and cakes, joking
and dancing, sugared saints and gilded Jésus. The
merry Flemish bells jingled everywhere on the horses;
everywhere within doors some well-filled soup-pot sang
and smoked over the stove; and everywhere over the
snow without laughing maidens pattered in bright
kerchiefs and stout kirtles, going to and from the mass.
Only in the little hut it was very dark and very cold.</p>

<p>Nello and Patrasche were left utterly alone, for one
night in the week before the Christmas Day, Death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
entered there, and took away from life forever old
Jehan Daas, who had never known of life aught save
its poverty and its pains. He had long been half dead,
incapable of any movement except a feeble gesture, and
powerless for anything beyond a gentle word; and yet
his loss fell on them both with a great horror in it:
they mourned him passionately. He had passed away
from them in his sleep, and when in the gray dawn
they learned their bereavement, unutterable solitude and
desolation seemed to close around them. He had long
been only a poor, feeble, paralyzed old man, who could
not raise a hand in their defence, but he had loved
them well: his smile had always welcomed their return.
They mourned for him unceasingly, refusing to be
comforted, as in the white winter day they followed the
deal shell that held his body to the nameless grave by
the little gray church. They were his only mourners,
these two whom he had left friendless upon earth—the
young boy and the old dog.</p>

<p>“Surely, he will relent now and let the poor lad come
hither?” thought the miller’s wife, glancing at her
husband where he smoked by the hearth.</p>

<p>Baas Cogez knew her thought, but he hardened his
heart, and would not unbar his door as the little,
humble funeral went by. “The boy is a beggar,” he
said to himself: “he shall not be about Alois.”</p>

<p>The woman dared not say anything aloud, but when
the grave was closed and the mourners had gone, she
put a wreath of immortelles into Alois’s hands and
bade her go and lay it reverently on the dark, unmarked
mound where the snow was displaced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Nello and Patrasche went home with broken hearts.
But even of that poor, melancholy, cheerless home
they were denied the consolation. There was a month’s
rent over-due for their little home, and when Nello had
paid the last sad service to the dead he had not a coin
left. He went and begged grace of the owner of the
hut, a cobbler who went every Sunday night to drink
his pint of wine and smoke with Baas Cogez. The
cobbler would grant no mercy. He was a harsh,
miserly man, and loved money. He claimed in default
of his rent every stick and stone, every pot and pan,
in the hut, and bade Nello and Patrasche be out of it
on the morrow.</p>

<p>Now, the cabin was lowly enough, and in some sense
miserable enough, and yet their hearts clove to it with
a great affection. They had been so happy there, and
in the summer, with its clambering vine and its flowering
beans, it was so pretty and bright in the midst of
the sun-lighted fields! There life in it had been full
of labor and privation, and yet they had been so well
content, so gay of heart, running together to meet the
old man’s never-failing smile of welcome!</p>

<p>All night long the boy and the dog sat by the fireless
hearth in the darkness, drawn close together for
warmth and sorrow. Their bodies were insensible to
the cold, but their hearts seemed frozen in them.</p>

<p>When the morning broke over the white, chill earth
it was the morning of Christmas Eve. With a shudder,
Nello clasped close to him his only friend, while
his tears fell hot and fast on the dog’s frank forehead.
“Let us go Patrasche—dear, dear Patrasche,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
murmured. “We will not wait to be kicked out: let
us go.”</p>

<p>Patrasche had no will but his, and they went sadly,
side by side, out from the little place which was so dear
to them both, and in which every humble, homely
thing was to them precious and beloved. Patrasche
drooped his head wearily as he passed by his own green
cart: it was no longer his—it had to go with the rest
to pay the rent, and his brass harness lay idle and
glittering on the snow. The dog could have lain down
beside it and died for very heart-sickness as he went,
but whilst the lad lived and needed him Patrasche
would not yield and give way.</p>

<p>They took the old accustomed road into Antwerp.
The day had yet scarce more than dawned, most of the
shutters were still closed, but some of the villagers
were about. They took no notice whilst the dog and
the boy passed by them. At one door Nello paused
and looked wistfully within: his grandfather had done
many a kindly turn in neighbor’s service to the people
who dwelt there.</p>

<p>“Would you give Patrasche a crust?” he said,
timidly. “He is old, and he has had nothing since
last forenoon.”</p>

<p>The woman shut the door hastily, murmuring some
vague saying about wheat and rye being very dear that
season. The boy and the dog went on again wearily:
they asked no more.</p>

<p>By slow and painful ways they reached Antwerp as
the chimes toiled ten.</p>

<p>“If I had anything about me I could sell to get him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
bread!” thought Nello, but he had nothing except the
wisp of linen and serge that covered him, and his pair
of wooden shoes.</p>

<p>Patrasche understood, and nestled his nose into the
lad’s hand, as though to pray him not to be disquieted
for any woe or want of his.</p>

<p>The winner of the drawing-prize was to be proclaimed
at noon, and to the public building where he
had left his treasure Nello made his way. On the steps
and in the entrance-hall there was a crowd of youths—some
of his age, some older, all with parents or relatives
or friends. His heart was sick with fear as he
went among them, holding Patrasche close to him.
The great bells of the city clashed out the hour of noon
with brazen clamor. The doors of the inner hall were
opened; the eager, panting throng rushed in: it was
known that the selected picture would be raised above
the rest upon a wooden dais.</p>

<p>A mist obscured Nello’s sight, his head swam, his
limbs almost failed him. When his vision cleared he
saw the drawing raised on high: it was not his own!
A slow, sonorous voice was proclaiming aloud that
victory had been adjudged to Stephan Kiesslinger, born
in the burgh of Antwerp, son of a wharfinger in that
town.</p>

<p>When Nello recovered his consciousness he was lying
on the stones without, and Patrasche was trying with
every art he knew to call him back to life. In the
distance a throng of the youths of Antwerp were shouting
around their successful comrade, and escorting him
with acclamations to his home upon the quay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy staggered to his feet and drew the dog into
his embrace. “It is all over, dear Patrasche,” he
murmured—“all over!”</p>

<p>He rallied himself as best he could, for he was weak
from fasting, and retraced his steps to the village.
Patrasche paced by his side with his head drooping
and his old limbs feeble from hunger and sorrow.</p>

<p>The snow was falling fast: a keen hurricane blew
from the north: it was bitter as death on the plains.
It took them long to traverse the familiar path, and
the bells were sounding four of the clock as they
approached the hamlet. Suddenly Patrasche paused,
arrested by a scent in the snow, scratched, whined, and
drew out with his teeth a small case of brown leather.
He held it up to Nello in the darkness. Where they
were there stood a little Calvary, and a lamp burned
dully under the cross: the boy mechanically turned the
case to the light: on it was the name of Baas Cogez,
and within it were notes for two thousand francs.</p>

<p>The sight roused the lad a little from his stupor.
He thrust it in his shirt, and stroked Patrasche and
drew him onward. The dog looked up wistfully in
his face.</p>

<p>Nello made straight for the mill-house, and went to
the house-door and struck on its panels. The miller’s
wife opened it weeping, with little Alois clinging close
to her skirts. “Is it thee, thou poor lad?” she said
kindly through her tears. “Get thee gone ere the
Baas see thee. We are in sore trouble to-night. He
is out seeking for a power of money that he has let fall
riding homeward, and in this snow he never will find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
it; and God knows it will go nigh to ruin us. It is
Heaven’s own judgment for the things we have done
to thee.”</p>

<p>Nello put the note-case in her hand and called Patrasche
within the house. “Patrasche found the money
to-night,” he said quickly. “Tell Baas Cogez so: I
think he will not deny the dog shelter and food in his
old age. Keep him from pursuing me, and I pray of
you to be good to him.”</p>

<p>Ere either woman or dog knew what he meant he
had stooped and kissed Patrasche: then closed the door
hurriedly, and disappeared in the gloom of the fast-falling
night.</p>

<p>The woman and the child stood speechless with joy
and fear: Patrasche vainly spent the fury of his
anguish against the iron-bound oak of the barred
house-door. They did not dare unbar the door and
let him forth: they tried all they could to solace him.
They brought him sweet cakes and juicy meats; they
tempted him with the best they had; they tried to lure
him to abide by the warmth of the hearth; but it was
of no avail. Patrasche refused to be comforted or to
stir from the barred portal.</p>

<p>It was six o’clock when from an opposite entrance
the miller at last came, jaded and broken, into his
wife’s presence. “It is lost forever,” he said with an
ashen cheek and a quiver in his stern voice. “We
have looked with lanterns everywhere: it is gone—the
little maiden’s portion and all!”</p>

<p>His wife put the money into his hand, and told him
how it had come to her. The strong man sank trembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
into a seat and covered his face, ashamed and
almost afraid. “I have been cruel to the lad,” he
muttered at length: “I deserved not to have good at
his hands.”</p>

<p>Little Alois, taking courage, crept close to her father
and nestled against him her fair curly head. “Nello
may come here again, father?” she whispered. “He
may come to-morrow as he used to do?”</p>

<p>The miller pressed her in his arms: his hard, sunburned
face was very pale and his mouth trembled.
“Surely, surely,” he answered his child. “He shall
bide here on Christmas Day, and any other day he will.
God helping me, I will make amends to the boy—I
will make amends.”</p>

<p>Little Alois kissed him in gratitude and joy, then
slid from his knees and ran to where the dog kept
watch by the door. “And to-night I may feast Patrasche?”
she cried in a child’s thoughtless glee.</p>

<p>Her father bent his head gravely: “Ay, ay: let the
dog have the best;” for the stern old man was moved
and shaken to his heart’s depths.</p>

<p>It was Christmas Eve, and the mill-house was filled
with oak logs and squares of turf, with cream and
honey, with meat and bread, and the rafters were hung
with wreaths of evergreen, and the Calvary and the
cuckoo clock looked out from a mass of holly. There
were little paper lanterns, too, for Alois, and toys of
various fashions and sweetmeats in bright-pictured
papers. There were light and warmth and abundance
everywhere, and the child would fain have made the
dog a guest honored and feasted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>But Patrasche would neither lie in the warmth nor
share in the cheer. Famished he was and very cold,
but without Nello he would partake neither of comfort
nor food. Against all temptation he was proof, and
close against the door he leaned always, watching only
for a means of escape.</p>

<p>“He wants the lad,” said Baas Cogez. “Good dog!
good dog! I will go over to the lad the first thing at
day-dawn.” For no one but Patrasche knew that Nello
had left the hut, and no one but Patrasche divined that
Nello had gone to face starvation and misery alone.</p>

<p>The mill-kitchen was very warm: great logs crackled
and flamed on the hearth; neighbors came in for a
glass of wine and a slice of the fat goose baking for
supper. Alois, gleeful and sure of her playmate back
on the morrow, bounded and sang and tossed back her
yellow hair. Baas Cogez, in the fulness of his heart,
smiled on her through moistened eyes, and spoke of the
way in which he would befriend her favorite companion;
the house-mother sat with calm, contented face at
the spinning-wheel; the cuckoo in the clock chirped
mirthful hours. Amidst it all Patrasche was bidden
with a thousand words of welcome to tarry there a
cherished guest. But neither peace nor plenty could
allure him where Nello was not.</p>

<p>When the supper smoked on the board, and the
voices were loudest and gladdest, and the Christ-child
brought choicest gifts to Alois, Patrasche, watching
always an occasion, glided out when the door was unlatched
by a careless new-comer, and as swiftly as his
weak and tired limbs would bear him sped over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
snow in the bitter, black night. He had only one
thought—to follow Nello. A human friend might
have paused for the pleasant meal, the cheery warmth,
the cosey slumber; but that was not the friendship of
Patrasche. He remembered a bygone time, when an
old man and a little child had found him sick unto
death in the wayside ditch.</p>

<p>Snow had fallen freshly all the evening long; it was
now nearly ten; the trail of the boy’s footsteps was
almost obliterated. It took Patrasche long to discover
any scent. When at last he found it, it was lost again
quickly, and lost and recovered, and again lost and
again recovered, a hundred times or more.</p>

<p>The night was very wild. The lamps under the
wayside crosses were blown out; the roads were sheets
of ice; the impenetrable darkness hid every trace of
habitations; there was no living thing abroad. All
the cattle were housed, and in all the huts and homesteads
men and women rejoiced and feasted. There
was only Patrasche out in the cruel cold—old and
famished and full of pain, but with the strength and
the patience of a great love to sustain him in his
search.</p>

<p>The trail of Nello’s steps, faint and obscure as it
was under the new snow, went straightly along the accustomed
tracks into Antwerp. It was past midnight
when Patrasche traced it over the boundaries of the
town and into the narrow, tortuous, gloomy streets.
It was all quite dark in the town, save where some
light gleamed ruddily through the crevices of house-shutters
or some group went homeward with lanterns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
chanting drinking-songs. The streets were all white
with ice: the high walls and roofs loomed black
against them. There was scarce a sound save the riot
of the winds down the passages as they tossed the
creaking signs and shook the tall lamp-irons.</p>

<p>So many passers-by had trodden through and through
the snow, so many diverse paths had crossed and re-crossed
each other, that the dog had a hard task to
retain any hold on the track he followed. But he kept
on his way, though the cold pierced him to the bone,
and the jagged ice cut his feet, and the hunger in his
body gnawed like a rat’s teeth. He kept on his way,
a poor gaunt, shivering thing, and by long patience
traced the steps he loved into the very heart of the
burgh and up to the steps of the great cathedral.</p>

<p>“He is gone to the things that he loved,” thought
Patrasche: he could not understand, but he was full
of sorrow and of pity for the art-passion that to him
was so incomprehensible and yet so sacred.</p>

<p>The portals of the cathedral were unclosed after the
midnight mass. Some heedlessness in the custodians,
too eager to go home and feast or sleep, or too drowsy to
know whether they turned the keys aright, had left one
of the doors unlocked. By that accident the foot-falls
Patrasche sought had passed through into the building,
leaving the white marks of snow upon the dark
stone floor. By that slender white thread, frozen as it
fell, he was guided through the intense silence, through
the immensity of the vaulted space—guided straight to
the gates of the chancel, and, stretched there upon the
stones, he found Nello. He crept up and touched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
face of the boy. “Didst thou dream that I should be
faithless and forsake thee? I—a dog?” said that mute
caress.</p>

<p>The lad raised himself with a low cry and clasped
him close. “Let us lie down and die together,” he
murmured. “Men have no need of us, and we are all
alone.”</p>

<p>In answer, Patrasche crept closer yet, and laid his
head upon the young boy’s breast. The great tears
stood in his brown, sad eyes: not for himself—for
himself he was happy.</p>

<p>They lay close together in the piercing cold. The
blasts that blew over the Flemish dikes from the
northern seas were like waves of ice, which froze every
living thing they touched. The interior of the immense
vault of stone in which they were was even
more bitterly chill than the snow-covered plains without.
Now and then a bat moved in the shadows—now
and then a gleam of light came on the ranks of carven
figures. Under the Rubens they lay together quite
still, and soothed almost into a dreaming slumber by
the numbing narcotic of the cold. Together they
dreamed of the old glad days when they had chased
each other through the flowering grasses of the summer
meadows, or sat hidden in the tall bulrushes by the
water’s side, watching the boats go seaward in the sun.</p>

<p>Suddenly through the darkness a great white radiance
streamed through the vastness of the aisles; the
moon, that was at her height, had broken through the
clouds, the snow had ceased to fall, the light reflected
from the snow without was clear as the light of dawn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
It fell through the arches full upon the two pictures
above, from which the boy on his entrance had flung
back the veil: the Elevation and the Descent of the
Cross were for one instant visible.</p>

<p>Nello rose to his feet and stretched his arms to them;
the tears of a passionate ecstasy glistened on the paleness
of his face. “I have seen them at last!” he cried
aloud. “O God, it is enough!”</p>

<p>His limbs failed under him, and he sank upon
his knees, still gazing upward at the majesty that he
adored. For a few brief moments the light illumined
the divine visions that had been denied to him so long—light
clear and sweet and strong as though it streamed
from the throne of Heaven. Then suddenly it passed
away: once more a great darkness covered the face of
Christ.</p>

<p>The arms of the boy drew close again the body of
the dog. “We shall see His face—<i>there</i>,” he murmured;
“and He will not part us, I think.”</p>

<p>On the morrow, by the chancel of the cathedral, the
people of Antwerp found them both. They were both
dead: the cold of the night had frozen into stillness
alike the young life and the old. When the Christmas
morning broke and the priests came to the temple,
they saw them lying thus on the stones together.
Above, the veils were drawn back from the great
visions of Rubens, and the fresh rays of the sunrise
touched the thorn-crowned head of the Christ.</p>

<p>As the day grew on there came an old, hard-featured
man who wept as women weep. “I was cruel to the
lad,” he muttered, “and now I would have made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
amends—yea, to the half of my substance—and he
should have been to me as a son.”</p>

<p>There came also, as the day grew apace, a painter
who had fame in the world, and who was liberal of
hand and of spirit. “I seek one who should have
had the prize yesterday had worth won,” he said to the
people—“a boy of rare promise and genius. An old
wood-cutter on a fallen tree at eventide—that was all
his theme. But there was greatness for the future in
it. I would fain find him, and take him with me and
teach him Art.”</p>

<p>And a little child with curling fair hair, sobbing bitterly
as she clung to her father’s arm, cried aloud, “Oh,
Nello, come! We have all ready for thee. The
Christ-child’s hands are full of gifts, and the old piper
will play for us; and the mother says thou shalt stay
by the hearth and burn nuts with us all the Noël week
long—yes, even to the Feast of the Kings! And Patrasche
will be so happy! Oh, Nello, wake and
come!”</p>

<p>But the young pale face, turned upward to the light
of the great Rubens with a smile upon its mouth, answered
them all, “It is too late.”</p>

<p>For the sweet, sonorous bells went ringing through
the frost, and the sunlight shone upon the plains of
snow, and the populace trooped gay and glad through
the streets, but Nello and Patrasche no more asked
charity at their hands. All they needed now Antwerp
gave unbidden.</p>

<p>Death had been more pitiful to them than longer life
would have been. It had taken the one in the loyalty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of love, and the other in the innocence of faith, from
a world which for love has no recompense and for faith
no fulfilment.</p>

<p>All their lives they had been together, and in their
deaths they were not divided: for when they were
found the arms of the boy were folded too closely
around the dog to be severed without violence, and the
people of their little village, contrite and ashamed,
implored a special grace for them, and, making them
one grave, laid them to rest there side by side—forever!</p>

<h2>THE NÜRNBERG STOVE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">August</span> lived in a little town called Hall. Hall is
a favorite name for several towns in Austria and in
Germany; but this one especial little Hall, in the
Upper Innthal, is one of the most charming Old-World
places that I know, and August for his part
did not know any other. It has the green meadows
and the great mountains all about it, and the gray-green
glacier-fed water rushes by it. It has paved
streets and enchanting little shops that have all latticed
panes and iron gratings to them; it has a very
grand old Gothic church, that has the noblest blendings
of light and shadow, and marble tombs of dead
knights, and a look of infinite strength and repose as a
church should have. Then there is the Muntze Tower,
black and white, rising out of greenery and looking
down on a long wooden bridge and the broad rapid
river; and there is an old schloss which has been made
into a guard-house, with battlements and frescos and
heraldic devices in gold and colors, and a man-at-arms
carved in stone standing life-size in his niche and
bearing his date 1530. A little farther on, but close
at hand, is a cloister with beautiful marble columns
and tombs, and a colossal wood-carved Calvary, and
beside that a small and very rich chapel: indeed, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
full is the little town of the undisturbed past, that to
walk in it is like opening a missal of the Middle Ages,
all emblazoned and illuminated with saints and warriors,
and it is so clean, and so still, and so noble, by
reason of its monuments and its historic color, that I
marvel much no one has ever cared to sing its praises.
The old pious heroic life of an age at once more restful
and more brave than ours still leaves its spirit there,
and then there is the girdle of the mountains all around,
and that alone means strength, peace, majesty.</p>

<p>In this little town a few years ago August Strehla
lived with his people in the stone-paved irregular
square where the grand church stands.</p>

<p>He was a small boy of nine years at that time,—a
chubby-faced little man with rosy cheeks, big hazel
eyes, and clusters of curls the brown of ripe nuts. His
mother was dead, his father was poor, and there were
many mouths at home to feed. In this country the
winters are long and very cold, the whole land lies
wrapped in snow for many months, and this night that
he was trotting home, with a jug of beer in his numb
red hands, was terribly cold and dreary. The good
burghers of Hall had shut their double shutters, and
the few lamps there were flickered dully behind their
quaint, old-fashioned iron casings. The mountains
indeed were beautiful, all snow-white under the stars
that are so big in frost. Hardly any one was astir;
a few good souls wending home from vespers, a tired
post-boy who blew a shrill blast from his tasselled
horn as he pulled up his sledge before a hostelry, and
little August hugging his jug of beer to his ragged
sheepskin coat, were all who were abroad, for the snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
fell heavily and the good folks of Hall go early to
their beds. He could not run, or he would have
spilled the beer; he was half frozen and a little frightened,
but he kept up his courage by saying over and
over again to himself, “I shall soon be at home with
dear Hirschvogel.”</p>

<p>He went on through the streets, past the stone man-at-arms
of the guard-house, and so into the place where
the great church was, and where near it stood his father
Karl Strehla’s house, with a sculptured Bethlehem over
the door-way, and the Pilgrimage of the Three Kings
painted on its wall. He had been sent on a long errand
outside the gates in the afternoon, over the frozen fields
and the broad white snow, and had been belated, and
had thought he had heard the wolves behind him at
every step, and had reached the town in a great state
of terror, thankful with all his little panting heart to
see the oil-lamp burning under the first house-shrine.
But he had not forgotten to call for the beer, and he
carried it carefully now, though his hands were so
numb that he was afraid they would let the jug down
every moment.</p>

<p>The snow outlined with white every gable and cornice
of the beautiful old wooden houses; the moonlight
shone on the gilded signs, the lambs, the grapes, the
eagles, and all the quaint devices that hung before the
doors; covered lamps burned before the Nativities
and Crucifixions painted on the walls or let into the
wood-work; here and there, where a shutter had not
been closed, a ruddy fire-light lit up a homely interior,
with the noisy band of children clustering round the
house-mother and a big brown loaf, or some gossips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
spinning and listening to the cobbler’s or the barber’s
story of a neighbor, while the oil-wicks glimmered,
and the hearth-logs blazed, and the chestnuts sputtered
in their iron roasting-pot. Little August saw all these
things, as he saw everything with his two big bright
eyes that had such curious lights and shadows in them;
but he went heedfully on his way for the sake of the
beer which a single slip of the foot would make him
spill. At his knock and call the solid oak door, four
centuries old if one, flew open, and the boy darted in
with his beer, and shouted, with all the force of mirthful
lungs, “Oh, dear Hirschvogel, but for the thought
of you I should have died!”</p>

<p>It was a large barren room into which he rushed
with so much pleasure, and the bricks were bare and
uneven. It had a walnut-wood press, handsome and
very old, a broad deal table, and several wooden stools
for all its furniture; but at the top of the chamber,
sending out warmth and color together as the lamp
shed its rays upon it, was a tower of porcelain, burnished
with all the hues of a king’s peacock and a
queen’s jewels, and surmounted with armed figures,
and shields, and flowers of heraldry, and a great golden
crown upon the highest summit of all.</p>

<p>It was a stove of 1532, and on it were the letters
H. R. H., for it was in every portion the handwork of
the great potter of Nürnberg, Augustin Hirschvogel,
who put his mark thus, as all the world knows.</p>

<p>The stove no doubt had stood in palaces and been
made for princes, had warmed the crimson stockings of
cardinals and the gold-broidered shoes of archduchesses,
had glowed in presence-chambers and lent its carbon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to help kindle sharp brains in anxious councils of state;
no one knew what it had seen or done or been fashioned
for; but it was a right royal thing. Yet perhaps it
had never been more useful than it was now in this
poor desolate room, sending down heat and comfort
into the troop of children tumbled together on a wolf-skin
at its feet, who received frozen August among
them with loud shouts of joy.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear Hirschvogel, I am so cold, so cold!” said
August, kissing its gilded lion’s claws. “Is father not
in, Dorothea?”</p>

<p>“No, dear. He is late.”</p>

<p>Dorothea was a girl of seventeen, dark-haired and
serious, and with a sweet sad face, for she had had
many cares laid on her shoulders, even whilst still a
mere baby. She was the eldest of the Strehla family;
and there were ten of them in all. Next to her there
came Jan and Karl and Otho, big lads, gaining a little
for their own living; and then came August, who went
up in the summer to the high alps with the farmers’
cattle, but in winter could do nothing to fill his own
little platter and pot; and then all the little ones, who
could only open their mouths to be fed like young
birds,—Albrecht and Hilda, and Waldo and Christof,
and last of all little three-year-old Ermengilda, with
eyes like forget-me-nots, whose birth had cost them
the life of their mother.</p>

<p>They were of that mixed race, half Austrian, half
Italian, so common in the Tyrol; some of the children
were white and golden as lilies, others were brown and
brilliant as fresh-fallen chestnuts. The father was a
good man, but weak and weary with so many to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
for and so little to do it with. He worked at the salt-furnaces,
and by that gained a few florins; people said
he would have worked better and kept his family more
easily if he had not loved his pipe and a draught of ale
too well; but this had only been said of him after his
wife’s death, when trouble and perplexity had begun
to dull a brain never too vigorous, and to enfeeble
further a character already too yielding. As it was,
the wolf often bayed at the door of the Strehla household,
without a wolf from the mountains coming down.
Dorothea was one of those maidens who almost work
miracles, so far can their industry and care and intelligence
make a home sweet and wholesome and a single
loaf seem to swell into twenty. The children were
always clean and happy, and the table was seldom
without its big pot of soup once a day. Still, very
poor they were, and Dorothea’s heart ached with
shame, for she knew that their father’s debts were
many for flour and meat and clothing. Of fuel to
feed the big stove they had always enough without
cost, for their mother’s father was alive, and sold wood
and fir cones and coke, and never grudged them to his
grandchildren, though he grumbled at Strehla’s improvidence
and hapless, dreamy ways.</p>

<p>“Father says we are never to wait for him: we will
have supper, now you have come home, dear,” said
Dorothea, who, however she might fret her soul in
secret as she knitted their hose and mended their
shirts, never let her anxieties cast a gloom on the children;
only to August she did speak a little sometimes,
because he was so thoughtful and so tender of her
always, and knew as well as she did that there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
troubles about money,—though these troubles were
vague to them both, and the debtors were patient and
kindly, being neighbors all in the old twisting streets
between the guard-house and the river.</p>

<p>Supper was a huge bowl of soup, with big slices of
brown bread swimming in it and some onions bobbing
up and down: the bowl was soon emptied by ten
wooden spoons, and then the three eldest boys slipped
off to bed, being tired with their rough bodily labor in
the snow all day, and Dorothea drew her spinning-wheel
by the stove and set it whirring, and the little
ones got August down upon the old worn wolf-skin
and clamored to him for a picture or a story. For
August was the artist of the family.</p>

<p>He had a piece of planed deal that his father had
given him, and some sticks of charcoal, and he would
draw a hundred things he had seen in the day, sweeping
each out with his elbow when the children had
seen enough of it and sketching another in its stead,—faces
and dogs’ heads, and men in sledges, and old
women in their furs, and pine-trees, and cocks and
hens, and all sorts of animals, and now and then—very
reverently—a Madonna and Child. It was all
very rough, for there was no one to teach him anything.
But it was all life-like, and kept the whole
troop of children shrieking with laughter, or watching
breathless, with wide open, wondering, awed eyes.</p>

<p>They were all so happy: what did they care for the
snow outside? Their little bodies were warm, and
their hearts merry; even Dorothea, troubled about the
bread for the morrow, laughed as she spun; and August,
with all his soul in his work, and little rosy Ermengilda’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
cheek on his shoulder, glowing after his
frozen afternoon, cried out loud, smiling, as he looked
up at the stove that was shedding its heat down on
them all,—</p>

<p>“Oh, dear Hirschvogel! you are almost as great and
good as the sun! No; you are greater and better, I
think, because he goes away nobody knows where all
these long, dark, cold hours, and does not care how
people die for want of him; but you—you are always
ready: just a little bit of wood to feed you, and you
will make a summer for us all the winter through!”</p>

<p>The grand old stove seemed to smile through all its
iridescent surface at the praises of the child. No doubt
the stove, though it had known three centuries and
more, had known but very little gratitude.</p>

<p>It was one of those magnificent stoves in enamelled
faïence which so excited the jealousy of the other potters
of Nürnberg that in a body they demanded of the
magistracy that Augustin Hirschvogel should be forbidden
to make any more of them,—the magistracy,
happily, proving of a broader mind, and having no
sympathy with the wish of the artisans to cripple their
greater fellow.</p>

<p>It was of great height and breadth, with all the
majolica lustre which Hirschvogel learned to give to
his enamels when he was making love to the young
Venetian girl whom he afterwards married. There
was the statue of a king at each corner, modelled with
as much force and splendor as his friend Albrecht
Dürer could have given unto them on copperplate or
canvas. The body of the stove itself was divided into
panels, which had the Ages of Man painted on them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
in polychrome; the borders of the panels had roses
and holly and laurel and other foliage, and German
mottoes in black letter of odd Old-World moralizing,
such as the old Teutons, and the Dutch after them,
love to have on their chimney-places and their drinking-cups,
their dishes and flagons. The whole was
burnished with gilding in many parts, and was radiant
everywhere with that brilliant coloring of which the
Hirschvogel family, painters on glass and great in
chemistry as they were, were all masters.</p>

<p>The stove was a very grand thing, as I say: possibly
Hirschvogel had made it for some mighty lord of the
Tyrol at that time when he was an imperial guest at
Innspruck and fashioned so many things for the Schloss
Amras and beautiful Philippine Welser, the burgher’s
daughter, who gained an archduke’s heart by her
beauty and the right to wear his honors by her wit.
Nothing was known of the stove at this latter day
in Hall. The grandfather Strehla, who had been a
master-mason, had dug it up out of some ruins where
he was building, and, finding it without a flaw, had
taken it home, and only thought it worth finding because
it was such a good one to burn. That was now
sixty years past, and ever since then the stove had
stood in the big desolate empty room, warming three
generations of the Strehla family, and having seen
nothing prettier perhaps in all its many years than
the children tumbled now in a cluster like gathered
flowers at its feet. For the Strehla children, born to
nothing else, were all born with beauty: white or
brown, they were equally lovely to look upon, and
when they went into the church to mass, with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
curling locks and their clasped hands, they stood under
the grim statues like cherubs flown down off some
fresco.</p>

<p>“Tell us a story, August,” they cried, in chorus,
when they had seen charcoal pictures till they were
tired; and August did as he did every night pretty
nearly,—looked up at the stove and told them what
he imagined of the many adventures and joys and sorrows
of the human being who figured on the panels
from his cradle to his grave.</p>

<p>To the children the stove was a household god. In
summer they laid a mat of fresh moss all round it, and
dressed it up with green boughs and the numberless
beautiful wild flowers of the Tyrol country. In winter
all their joys centred in it, and scampering home
from school over the ice and snow they were happy,
knowing that they would soon be cracking nuts or
roasting chestnuts in the broad ardent glow of its noble
tower, which rose eight feet high above them with all
its spires and pinnacles and crowns.</p>

<p>Once a travelling peddler had told them that the
letters on it meant Augustin Hirschvogel, and that
Hirschvogel had been a great German potter and
painter, like his father before him, in the art-sanctified
city of Nürnberg, and had made many such stoves,
that were all miracles of beauty and of workmanship,
putting all his heart and his soul and his faith into his
labors, as the men of those earlier ages did, and thinking
but little of gold or praise.</p>

<p>An old trader too, who sold curiosities not far from
the church, had told August a little more about the
brave family of Hirschvogel, whose houses can be seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
in Nürnberg to this day; of old Veit, the first of them,
who painted the Gothic windows of St. Sebald with
the marriage of the Margravine; of his sons and of
his grandsons, potters, painters, engravers all, and
chief of them great Augustin, the Luca della Robbia
of the North. And August’s imagination, always
quick, had made a living personage out of these few
records, and saw Hirschvogel as though he were in the
flesh walking up and down the Maximilian-Strass in
his visit to Innspruck, and maturing beautiful things
in his brain as he stood on the bridge and gazed on the
emerald-green flood of the Inn.</p>

<p>So the stove had got to be called Hirschvogel in the
family, as if it were a living creature, and little August
was very proud because he had been named after that
famous old dead German who had had the genius to
make so glorious a thing. All the children loved the
stove, but with August the love of it was a passion;
and in his secret heart he used to say to himself,
“When I am a man, I will make just such things too,
and then I will set Hirschvogel in a beautiful room in
a house that I will build myself in Innspruck just
outside the gates, where the chestnuts are, by the river:
that is what I will do when I am a man.”</p>

<p>For August, a salt-baker’s son and a little cow-keeper
when he was anything, was a dreamer of
dreams, and when he was upon the high alps with his
cattle, with the stillness and the sky around him, was
quite certain that he would live for greater things than
driving the herds up when the spring-tide came among
the blue sea of gentians, or toiling down in the town
with wood and with timber as his father and grandfather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
did every day of their lives. He was a strong
and healthy little fellow, fed on the free mountain-air,
and he was very happy, and loved his family devotedly,
and was as active as a squirrel and as playful as a hare;
but he kept his thoughts to himself, and some of them
went a very long way for a little boy who was only
one among many, and to whom nobody had ever
paid any attention except to teach him his letters and
tell him to fear God. August in winter was only a
little, hungry school-boy, trotting to be catechised by
the priest, or to bring the loaves from the bake-house,
or to carry his father’s boots to the cobbler; and in
summer he was only one of hundreds of cow-boys,
who drove the poor, half-blind, blinking, stumbling
cattle, ringing their throat-bells, out into the sweet intoxication
of the sudden sunlight, and lived up with
them in the heights among the Alpine roses, with only
the clouds and the snow-summits near. But he was
always thinking, thinking, thinking, for all that; and
under his little sheepskin winter coat and his rough
hempen summer shirt his heart had as much courage
in it as Hofer’s ever had,—great Hofer, who is a household
word in all the Innthal, and whom August always
reverently remembered when he went to the city of
Innspruck and ran out by the foaming water-mill and
under the wooded height of Berg Isel.</p>

<p>August lay now in the warmth of the stove and told
the children stories, his own little brown face growing
red with excitement as his imagination glowed to
fever-heat. That human being on the panels, who was
drawn there as a baby in a cradle, as a boy playing
among flowers, as a lover sighing under a casement, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
a soldier in the midst of strife, as a father with children
round him, as a weary, old, blind man on crutches,
and, lastly, as a ransomed soul raised up by angels, had
always had the most intense interest for August, and
he had made, not one history for him, but a thousand;
he seldom told them the same tale twice. He had
never seen a story-book in his life; his primer and his
mass-book were all the volumes he had. But nature
had given him Fancy, and she is a good fairy that
makes up for the want of very many things! only,
alas! her wings are so very soon broken, poor thing,
and then she is of no use at all.</p>

<p>“It is time for you all to go to bed, children,” said
Dorothea, looking up from her spinning. “Father is
very late to-night; you must not sit up for him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, five minutes more, dear Dorothea!” they
pleaded; and little rosy and golden Ermengilda climbed
up into her lap. “Hirschvogel is so warm, the beds
are never so warm as he. Cannot you tell us another
tale, August?”</p>

<p>“No,” cried August, whose face had lost its light,
now that his story had come to an end, and who sat
serious, with his hands clasped on his knees, gazing on
to the luminous arabesques of the stove.</p>

<p>“It is only a week to Christmas,” he said, suddenly.</p>

<p>“Grandmother’s big cakes!” chuckled little Christof,
who was five years old, and thought Christmas meant
a big cake and nothing else.</p>

<p>“What will Santa Claus find for ’Gilda if she be
good?” murmured Dorothea over the child’s sunny
head; for, however hard poverty might pinch, it could
never pinch so tightly that Dorothea would not find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
some wooden toy and some rosy apples to put in her
little sister’s socks.</p>

<p>“Father Max has promised me a big goose, because
I saved the calf’s life in June,” said August; it was
the twentieth time he had told them so that month, he
was so proud of it.</p>

<p>“And Aunt Maïla will be sure to send us wine and
honey and a barrel of flour; she always does,” said
Albrecht. Their aunt Maïla had a chalet and a little
farm over on the green slopes towards Dorp Ampas.</p>

<p>“I shall go up into the woods and get Hirschvogel’s
crown,” said August; they always crowned Hirschvogel
for Christmas with pine boughs and ivy and
mountain-berries. The heat soon withered the crown;
but it was part of the religion of the day to them, as
much so as it was to cross themselves in church and
raise their voices in the “O Salutaris Hostia.”</p>

<p>And they fell chatting of all they would do on the
Christ-night, and one little voice piped loud against
another’s, and they were as happy as though their
stockings would be full of golden purses and jewelled
toys, and the big goose in the soup-pot seemed to them
such a meal as kings would envy.</p>

<p>In the midst of their chatter and laughter a blast of
frozen air and a spray of driven snow struck like ice
through the room, and reached them even in the warmth
of the old wolf-skins and the great stove. It was the
door which had opened and let in the cold; it was
their father who had come home.</p>

<p>The younger children ran joyous to meet him.
Dorothea pushed the one wooden arm-chair of the
room to the stove, and August flew to set the jug of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
beer on a little round table, and fill a long clay pipe;
for their father was good to them all, and seldom
raised his voice in anger, and they had been trained by
the mother they had loved to dutifulness and obedience
and a watchful affection.</p>

<p>To-night Karl Strehla responded very wearily to the
young ones’ welcome, and came to the wooden chair
with a tired step and sat down heavily, not noticing
either pipe or beer.</p>

<p>“Are you not well, dear father?” his daughter
asked him.</p>

<p>“I am well enough,” he answered, dully, and sat
there with his head bent, letting the lighted pipe grow
cold.</p>

<p>He was a fair, tall man, gray before his time, and
bowed with labor.</p>

<p>“Take the children to bed,” he said, suddenly, at
last, and Dorothea obeyed. August stayed behind,
curled before the stove; at nine years old, and when
one earns money in the summer from the farmers, one
is not altogether a child any more, at least in one’s own
estimation.</p>

<p>August did not heed his father’s silence: he was
used to it. Karl Strehla was a man of few words, and,
being of weakly health, was usually too tired at the
end of the day to do more than drink his beer and
sleep. August lay on the wolf-skin, dreamy and comfortable,
looking up through his drooping eyelids at
the golden coronets on the crest of the great stove, and
wondering for the millionth time whom it had been
made for, and what grand places and scenes it had
known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Dorothea came down from putting the little ones in
their beds; the cuckoo-clock in the corner struck eight;
she looked to her father and the untouched pipe, then
sat down to her spinning, saying nothing. She thought
he had been drinking in some tavern; it had been often
so with him of late.</p>

<p>There was a long silence; the cuckoo called the
quarter twice; August dropped asleep, his curls falling
over his face; Dorothea’s wheel hummed like a
cat.</p>

<p>Suddenly Karl Strehla struck his hand on the table,
sending the pipe on the ground.</p>

<p>“I have sold Hirschvogel,” he said; and his voice
was husky and ashamed in his throat. The spinning-wheel
stopped. August sprang erect out of his sleep.</p>

<p>“Sold Hirschvogel!” If their father had dashed
the holy crucifix on the floor at their feet and spat on
it, they could not have shuddered under the horror of
a greater blasphemy.</p>

<p>“I have sold Hirschvogel!” said Karl Strehla, in
the same husky, dogged voice. “I have sold it to a
travelling trader in such things for two hundred florins.
What would you?—I owe double that. He saw it
this morning when you were all out. He will pack it
and take it to Munich to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Dorothea gave a low shrill cry:</p>

<p>“Oh, father!—the children—in mid-winter!”</p>

<p>She turned white as the snow without; her words
died away in her throat.</p>

<p>August stood, half blind with sleep, staring with
dazed eyes as his cattle stared at the sun when they
came out from their winter’s prison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is not true! It is not true!” he muttered.
“You are jesting, father?”</p>

<p>Strehla broke into a dreary laugh.</p>

<p>“It is true. Would you like to know what is true
too?—that the bread you eat, and the meat you put in
this pot, and the roof you have over your heads, are
none of them paid for, have been none of them paid
for for months and months: if it had not been for your
grandfather I should have been in prison all summer
and autumn, and he is out of patience and will do no
more now. There is no work to be had; the masters
go to younger men: they say I work ill; it may be so.
Who can keep his head above water with ten hungry
children dragging him down? When your mother
lived, it was different. Boy, you stare at me as if I
were a mad dog! You have made a god of yon china
thing. Well—it goes: goes to-morrow. Two hundred
florins, that is something. It will keep me out
of prison for a little, and with the spring things may
turn——”</p>

<p>August stood like a creature paralyzed. His eyes
were wide open, fastened on his father’s with terror and
incredulous horror; his face had grown as white as his
sister’s; his chest heaved with tearless sobs.</p>

<p>“It is not true! It is not true!” he echoed, stupidly.
It seemed to him that the very skies must fall, and
the earth perish, if they could take away Hirschvogel.
They might as soon talk of tearing down God’s sun
out of the heavens.</p>

<p>“You will find it true,” said his father, doggedly,
and angered because he was in his own soul bitterly
ashamed to have bartered away the heirloom and treasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of his race and the comfort and health-giver of his
young children. “You will find it true. The dealer
has paid me half the money to-night, and will pay me
the other half to-morrow when he packs it up and
takes it away to Munich. No doubt it is worth a great
deal more,—at least I suppose so, as he gives that,—but
beggars cannot be choosers. The little black stove
in the kitchen will warm you all just as well. Who
would keep a gilded, painted thing in a poor house like
this, when one can make two hundred florins by it?
Dorothea, you never sobbed more when your mother
died. What is it, when all is said?—a bit of hardware
much too grand-looking for such a room as this.
If all the Strehlas had not been born fools it would
have been sold a century ago, when it was dug up
out of the ground. ‘It is a stove for a museum,’
the trader said when he saw it. To a museum let it
go.”</p>

<p>August gave a shrill shriek like a hare’s when it is
caught for its death, and threw himself on his knees
at his father’s feet.</p>

<p>“Oh, father, father!” he cried, convulsively, his
hands closing on Strehla’s knees, and his uplifted face
blanched and distorted with terror. “Oh, father, dear
father, you cannot mean what you say? Send <i>it</i> away—our
life, our sun, our joy, our comfort? We shall
all die in the dark and the cold. Sell <i>me</i> rather. Sell
me to any trade or any pain you like; I will not mind.
But Hirschvogel!—it is like selling the very cross off
the altar! You must be in jest. You could not do
such a thing—you could not!—you who have always
been gentle and good, and who have sat in the warmth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
here year after year with our mother. It is not a
piece of hardware, as you say; it is a living thing, for
a great man’s thoughts and fancies have put life into
it, and it loves us though we are only poor little children,
and we love it with all our hearts and souls, and
up in heaven I am sure the dead Hirschvogel knows!
Oh, listen; I will go and try and get work to-morrow!
I will ask them to let me cut ice or make the paths
through the snow. There must be something I could
do, and I will beg the people we owe money to to wait;
they are all neighbors, they will be patient. But sell
Hirschvogel!—oh, never! never! never! Give the
florins back to the vile man. Tell him it would be
like selling the shroud out of mother’s coffin, or the
golden curls off Ermengilda’s head! Oh, father, dear
father! do hear me, for pity’s sake!”</p>

<p>Strehla was moved by the boy’s anguish. He loved
his children, though he was often weary of them, and
their pain was pain to him. But besides emotion, and
stronger than emotion, was the anger that August
roused in him: he hated and despised himself for the
barter of the heirloom of his race, and every word of
the child stung him with a stinging sense of shame.</p>

<p>And he spoke in his wrath rather than in his sorrow.</p>

<p>“You are a little fool,” he said, harshly, as they had
never heard him speak. “You rave like a play-actor.
Get up and go to bed. The stove is sold. There is
no more to be said. Children like you have nothing
to do with such matters. The stove is sold, and goes
to Munich to-morrow. What is it to you? Be thankful
I can get bread for you. Get on your legs, I say,
and go to bed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Strehla took up the jug of ale as he paused, and
drained it slowly as a man who had no cares.</p>

<p>August sprang to his feet and threw his hair back
off his face; the blood rushed into his cheeks, making
them scarlet; his great soft eyes flamed alight with
furious passion.</p>

<p>“You <i>dare</i> not!” he cried, aloud, “you dare not sell
it, I say! It is not yours alone; it is ours——”</p>

<p>Strehla flung the emptied jug on the bricks with a
force that shivered it to atoms, and, rising to his feet,
struck his son a blow that felled him to the floor. It
was the first time in all his life that he had ever raised
his hand against any one of his children.</p>

<p>Then he took the oil-lamp that stood at his elbow
and stumbled off to his own chamber with a cloud
before his eyes.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” said August, a little while
later, as he opened his eyes and saw Dorothea weeping
above him on the wolf-skin before the stove. He had
been struck backward, and his head had fallen on the
hard bricks where the wolf-skin did not reach. He
sat up a moment, with his face bent upon his hands.</p>

<p>“I remember now,” he said, very low, under his
breath.</p>

<p>Dorothea showered kisses on him, while her tears
fell like rain.</p>

<p>“But, oh, dear, how could you speak so to father?”
she murmured. “It was very wrong.”</p>

<p>“No, I was right,” said August, and his little mouth,
that hitherto had only curled in laughter, curved downward
with a fixed and bitter seriousness. “How dare
he? How dare he?” he muttered, with his head sunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
in his hands. “It is not his alone. It belongs to us
all. It is as much yours and mine as it is his.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 432px;">
<img src="images/i-091.jpg" width="432" height="600" alt="Woman talking to boy on floor" />
<div class="caption">“IT IS A SIN, IT IS A THEFT, IT IS AN INFAMY,” HE SAID</div>
</div>

<p>Dorothea could only sob in answer. She was too
frightened to speak. The authority of their parents
in the house had never in her remembrance been questioned.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt by the fall, dear August?” she murmured,
at length, for he looked to her so pale and
strange.</p>

<p>“Yes—no. I do not know. What does it matter?”</p>

<p>He sat up upon the wolf-skin with passionate pain
upon his face; all his soul was in rebellion, and he was
only a child and was powerless.</p>

<p>“It is a sin; it is a theft; it is an infamy,” he said,
slowly, his eyes fastened on the gilded feet of Hirschvogel.</p>

<p>“Oh, August, do not say such things of father!”
sobbed his sister. “Whatever he does, we ought to
think it right.”</p>

<p>August laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“Is it right that he should spend his money in
drink?—that he should let orders lie unexecuted?—that
he should do his work so ill that no one cares to
employ him?—that he should live on grandfather’s
charity, and then dare sell a thing that is ours every
whit as much as it is his? To sell Hirschvogel! Oh,
dear God! I would sooner sell my soul!”</p>

<p>“August!” cried Dorothea, with piteous entreaty.
He terrified her, she could not recognize her little, gay,
gentle brother in those fierce and blasphemous words.</p>

<p>August laughed aloud again; then all at once his
laughter broke down into bitterest weeping. He threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
himself forward on the stove, covering it with kisses,
and sobbing as though his heart would burst from his
bosom.</p>

<p>What could he do? Nothing, nothing, nothing!</p>

<p>“August, dear August,” whispered Dorothea, piteously,
and trembling all over,—for she was a very
gentle girl, and fierce feeling terrified her,—“August,
do not lie there. Come to bed: it is quite late. In
the morning you will be calmer. It is horrible indeed,
and we shall die of cold, at least the little ones; but
if it be father’s will——”</p>

<p>“Let me alone,” said August, through his teeth,
striving to still the storm of sobs that shook him from
head to foot. “Let me alone. In the morning!—how
can you speak of the morning?”</p>

<p>“Come to bed, dear,” sighed his sister. “Oh,
August, do not lie and look like that! you frighten
me. Do come to bed.”</p>

<p>“I shall stay here.”</p>

<p>“Here! all night!”</p>

<p>“They might take it in the night. Besides, to leave
it now!”</p>

<p>“But it is cold! the fire is out.”</p>

<p>“It will never be warm any more, nor shall we.”</p>

<p>All his childhood had gone out of him, all his gleeful,
careless, sunny temper had gone with it; he spoke
sullenly and wearily, choking down the great sobs in
his chest. To him it was as if the end of the world
had come.</p>

<p>His sister lingered by him while striving to persuade
him to go to his place in the little crowded bedchamber
with Albrecht and Waldo and Christof. But it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
in vain. “I shall stay here,” was all he answered her.
And he stayed,—all the night long.</p>

<p>The lamps went out; the rats came and ran across
the floor; as the hours crept on through midnight and
past, the cold intensified and the air of the room grew
like ice. August did not move; he lay with his face
downward on the golden and rainbow-hued pedestal of
the household treasure, which henceforth was to be cold
for evermore, an exiled thing in a foreign city in a far-off
land.</p>

<p>Whilst yet it was dark his three elder brothers came
down the stairs and let themselves out, each bearing his
lantern and going to his work in stone-yard and timber-yard
and at the salt-works. They did not notice him;
they did not know what had happened.</p>

<p>A little later his sister came down with a light in
her hand to make ready the house ere morning should
break.</p>

<p>She stole up to him and laid her hand on his shoulder
timidly.</p>

<p>“Dear August, you must be frozen. August, do
look up! do speak!”</p>

<p>August raised his eyes with a wild, feverish, sullen
look in them that she had never seen there. His face
was ashen white: his lips were like fire. He had not
slept all night; but his passionate sobs had given way
to delirious waking dreams and numb senseless trances,
which had alternated one on another all through the
freezing, lonely, horrible hours.</p>

<p>“It will never be warm again,” he muttered, “never
again!”</p>

<p>Dorothea clasped him with trembling hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“August! do you not know me?” she cried, in an
agony. “I am Dorothea. Wake up, dear—wake up!
It is morning, only so dark!”</p>

<p>August shuddered all over.</p>

<p>“The morning!” he echoed.</p>

<p>He slowly rose up on to his feet.</p>

<p>“I will go to grandfather,” he said, very low. “He
is always good: perhaps he could save it.”</p>

<p>Loud blows with the heavy iron knocker of the
house-door drowned his words. A strange voice called
aloud through the keyhole,—</p>

<p>“Let me in! Quick!—there is no time to lose!
More snow like this, and the roads will all be blocked.
Let me in! Do you hear? I am come to take the
great stove.”</p>

<p>August sprang erect, his fists doubled, his eyes
blazing.</p>

<p>“You shall never touch it!” he screamed; “you
shall never touch it!”</p>

<p>“Who shall prevent us?” laughed a big man, who
was a Bavarian, amused at the fierce little figure fronting
him.</p>

<p>“I!” said August. “You shall never have it! you
shall kill me first!”</p>

<p>“Strehla,” said the big man, as August’s father
entered the room, “you have got a little mad dog here:
muzzle him.”</p>

<p>One way and another they did muzzle him. He
fought like a little demon, and hit out right and left,
and one of his blows gave the Bavarian a black eye.
But he was soon mastered by four grown men, and his
father flung him with no light hand out from the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of the back entrance, and the buyers of the stately and
beautiful stove set to work to pack it heedfully and
carry it away.</p>

<p>When Dorothea stole out to look for August, he was
nowhere in sight. She went back to little ’Gilda, who
was ailing, and sobbed over the child, whilst the others
stood looking on, dimly understanding that with
Hirschvogel was going all the warmth of their bodies,
all the light of their hearth.</p>

<p>Even their father now was sorry and ashamed; but
two hundred florins seemed a big sum to him, and,
after all, he thought the children could warm themselves
quite as well at the black iron stove in the
kitchen. Besides, whether he regretted it now or not,
the work of the Nürnberg potter was sold irrevocably,
and he had to stand still and see the men from Munich
wrap it in manifold wrappings and bear it out into the
snowy air to where an ox-cart stood in waiting for it.</p>

<p>In another moment Hirschvogel was gone,—gone
forever and aye.</p>

<p>August had stood still for a time, leaning, sick and
faint from the violence that had been used to him,
against the back wall of the house. The wall looked
on a court where a well was, and the backs of other
houses, and beyond them the spire of the Muntze
Tower and the peaks of the mountains.</p>

<p>Into the court an old neighbor hobbled for water,
and, seeing the boy, said to him,—</p>

<p>“Child, is it true your father is selling the big painted
stove?”</p>

<p>August nodded his head, then burst into a passion of
tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, for sure he is a fool,” said the neighbor.
“Heaven forgive me for calling him so before his own
child! but the stove was worth a mint of money. I
do remember in my young days, in old Anton’s time
(that was your great-grandfather, my lad), a stranger
from Vienna saw it, and said that it was worth its
weight in gold.”</p>

<p>August’s sobs went on their broken, impetuous
course.</p>

<p>“I loved it! I loved it!” he moaned. “I do not
care what its value was. I loved it! <i>I loved it!</i>”</p>

<p>“You little simpleton!” said the old man, kindly.
“But you are wiser than your father, when all’s said.
If sell it he must, he should have taken it to good
Herr Steiner over at Sprüz, who would have given
him honest value. But no doubt they took him over
his beer,—ay, ay! but if I were you I would do better
than cry. I would go after it.”</p>

<p>August raised his head, the tears raining down his
cheeks.</p>

<p>“Go after it when you are bigger,” said the neighbor,
with a good-natured wish to cheer him up a little.
“The world is a small thing after all: I was a travelling
clockmaker once upon a time, and I know that
your stove will be safe enough whoever gets it; anything
that can be sold for a round sum is always
wrapped up in cotton wool by everybody. Ay, ay,
don’t cry so much; you will see your stove again some
day.”</p>

<p>Then the old man hobbled away to draw his brazen
pail full of water at the well.</p>

<p>August remained leaning against the wall; his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
was buzzing and his heart fluttering with the new idea
which had presented itself to his mind. “Go after
it,” had said the old man. He thought, “Why not go
with it?” He loved it better than any one, even better
than Dorothea; and he shrank from the thought of
meeting his father again, his father who had sold
Hirschvogel.</p>

<p>He was by this time in that state of exaltation in
which the impossible looks quite natural and commonplace.
His tears were still wet on his pale cheeks, but
they had ceased to fall. He ran out of the court-yard
by a little gate, and across to the huge Gothic porch of
the church. From there he could watch unseen his
father’s house-door, at which were always hanging some
blue-and-gray pitchers, such as are common and so
picturesque in Austria, for a part of the house was let
to a man who dealt in pottery.</p>

<p>He hid himself in the grand portico, which he had
so often passed through to go to mass or complin
within, and presently his heart gave a great leap, for
he saw the straw-enwrapped stove brought out and laid
with infinite care on the bullock-dray. Two of the
Bavarian men mounted beside it, and the sleigh-wagon
slowly crept over the snow of the place,—snow crisp
and hard as stone. The noble old minster looked its
grandest and most solemn, with its dark-gray stone
and its vast archways, and its porch that was itself as
big as many a church, and its strange gargoyles and
lamp-irons black against the snow on its roof and
on the pavement; but for once August had no eyes
for it: he only watched for his old friend. Then
he, a little unnoticeable figure enough, like a score<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of other boys in Hall, crept, unseen by any of his
brothers or sisters, out of the porch and over the
shelving uneven square, and followed in the wake of
the dray.</p>

<p>Its course lay towards the station of the railway,
which is close to the salt-works, whose smoke at times
sullies this part of clean little Hall, though it does not
do very much damage. From Hall the iron road
runs northward through glorious country to Salzburg,
Vienna, Prague, Buda, and southward over the Brenner
into Italy. Was Hirschvogel going north or south?
This at least he would soon know.</p>

<p>August had often hung about the little station, watching
the trains come and go and dive into the heart of
the hills and vanish. No one said anything to him
for idling about; people are kind-hearted and easy of
temper in this pleasant land, and children and dogs are
both happy there. He heard the Bavarians arguing
and vociferating a great deal, and learned that they
meant to go too and wanted to go with the great stove
itself. But this they could not do, for neither could
the stove go by a passenger-train nor they themselves
go in a goods-train. So at length they insured their
precious burden for a large sum, and consented to send
it by a luggage-train which was to pass through Hall
in half an hour. The swift trains seldom deign to
notice the existence of Hall at all.</p>

<p>August heard, and a desperate resolve made itself
up in his little mind. Where Hirschvogel went would
he go. He gave one terrible thought to Dorothea—poor,
gentle Dorothea!—sitting in the cold at home,
then set to work to execute his project. How he managed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
it he never knew very clearly himself, but certain
it is that when the goods-train from the north, that
had come all the way from Linz on the Danube,
moved out of Hall, August was hidden behind the
stove in the great covered truck, and wedged, unseen
and undreamt of by any human creature, amidst the
cases of wood-carving, of clocks and clock-work, of
Vienna toys, of Turkish carpets, of Russian skins, of
Hungarian wines, which shared the same abode as did
his swathed and bound Hirschvogel. No doubt he
was very naughty, but it never occurred to him that
he was so: his whole mind and soul were absorbed in
the one entrancing idea, to follow his beloved friend
and fire-king.</p>

<p>It was very dark in the closed truck, which had only
a little window above the door; and it was crowded,
and had a strong smell in it from the Russian hides
and the hams that were in it. But August was not
frightened; he was close to Hirschvogel, and presently
he meant to be closer still; for he meant to do
nothing less than get inside Hirschvogel itself. Being
a shrewd little boy, and having had by great luck
two silver groschen in his breeches-pocket, which he
had earned the day before by chopping wood, he had
bought some bread and sausage at the station of a
woman there who knew him, and who thought he was
going out to his uncle Joachim’s chalet above Jenbach.
This he had with him, and this he ate in the
darkness and the lumbering, pounding, thundering
noise which made him giddy, as never had he been
in a train of any kind before. Still he ate, having
had no breakfast, and being a child, and half a German,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and not knowing at all how or when he ever would
eat again.</p>

<p>When he had eaten, not as much as he wanted, but
as much as he thought was prudent (for who could say
when he would be able to buy anything more?), he set
to work like a little mouse to make a hole in the withes
of straw and hay which enveloped the stove. If it had
been put in a packing-case he would have been defeated
at the onset. As it was, he gnawed, and nibbled, and
pulled, and pushed, just as a mouse would have done,
making his hole where he guessed that the opening of
the stove was,—the opening through which he had so
often thrust the big oak logs to feed it. No one disturbed
him; the heavy train went lumbering on and
on, and he saw nothing at all of the beautiful mountains,
and shining waters, and great forests through
which he was being carried. He was hard at work
getting through the straw and hay and twisted ropes;
and get through them at last he did, and found the
door of the stove, which he knew so well, and which
was quite large enough for a child of his age to slip
through, and it was this which he had counted upon
doing. Slip through he did, as he had often done at
home for fun, and curled himself up there to see if he
could anyhow remain during many hours. He found
that he could; air came in through the brass fret-work
of the stove; and with admirable caution in such a
little fellow he leaned out, drew the hay and straw together,
and rearranged the ropes, so that no one could
ever have dreamed a little mouse had been at them.
Then he curled himself up again, this time more like
a dormouse than anything else; and, being safe inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
his dear Hirschvogel and intensely cold, he went fast
asleep as if he were in his own bed at home with Albrecht
and Christof on either side of him. The train
lumbered on, stopping often and long, as the habit of
goods-trains is, sweeping the snow away with its cow-switcher,
and rumbling through the deep heart of the
mountains, with its lamps aglow like the eyes of a dog
in a night of frost.</p>

<p>The train rolled on in its heavy, slow fashion, and
the child slept soundly for a long while. When he
did awake, it was quite dark outside in the land; he
could not see, and of course he was in absolute darkness;
and for a while he was sorely frightened, and
trembled terribly, and sobbed in a quiet heart-broken
fashion, thinking of them all at home. Poor Dorothea!
how anxious she would be! How she would
run over the town and walk up to grandfather’s at
Dorf Ampas, and perhaps even send over to Jenbach,
thinking he had taken refuge with Uncle Joachim!
His conscience smote him for the sorrow he must be
even then causing to his gentle sister; but it never
occurred to him to try and go back. If he once were
to lose sight of Hirschvogel how could he ever hope to
find it again? how could he ever know whither it had
gone,—north, south, east, or west? The old neighbor
had said that the world was small; but August knew
at least that it must have a great many places in it:
that he had seen himself on the maps on his school-house
walls. Almost any other little boy would, I
think, have been frightened out of his wits at the position
in which he found himself; but August was
brave, and he had a firm belief that God and Hirschvogel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
would take care of him. The master-potter of
Nürnberg was always present to his mind, a kindly,
benign, and gracious spirit, dwelling manifestly in that
porcelain tower whereof he had been the maker.</p>

<p>A droll fancy, you say? But every child with a
soul in him has quite as quaint fancies as this one was
of August’s.</p>

<p>So he got over his terror and his sobbing both,
though he was so utterly in the dark. He did not
feel cramped at all, because the stove was so large, and
air he had in plenty, as it came through the fret-work
running round the top. He was hungry again, and
again nibbled with prudence at his loaf and his sausage.
He could not at all tell the hour. Every time the train
stopped and he heard the banging, stamping, shouting,
and jangling of chains that went on, his heart seemed
to jump up into his mouth. If they should find him
out! Sometimes porters came and took away this case
and the other, a sack here, a bale there, now a big bag,
now a dead chamois. Every time the men trampled
near him, and swore at each other, and banged this
and that to and fro, he was so frightened that his very
breath seemed to stop. When they came to lift the
stove out, would they find him? and if they did find
him, would they kill him? That was what he kept
thinking of all the way, all through the dark hours,
which seemed without end. The goods-trains are
usually very slow, and are many days doing what a
quick train does in a few hours. This one was quicker
than most, because it was bearing goods to the King
of Bavaria; still it took all the short winter’s day
and the long winter’s night and half another day to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
over ground that the mail-trains cover in a forenoon.
It passed great armored Kuffstein standing across the
beautiful and solemn gorge, denying the right of way
to all the foes of Austria. It passed twelve hours later,
after lying by in out-of-the-way stations, pretty Rosenheim,
that marks the border of Bavaria. And here
the Nürnberg stove, with August inside it, was lifted
out heedfully and set under a covered way. When it
was lifted out, the boy had hard work to keep in his
screams; he was tossed to and fro as the men lifted the
huge thing, and the earthenware walls of his beloved
fire-king were not cushions of down. However, though
they swore and grumbled at the weight of it, they never
suspected that a living child was inside it, and they
carried it out on to the platform and set it down under
the roof of the goods-shed. There it passed the rest
of the night and all the next morning, and August
was all the while within it.</p>

<p>The winds of early winter sweep bitterly over Rosenheim,
and all the vast Bavarian plain was one white
sheet of snow. If there had not been whole armies of
men at work always clearing the iron rails of the snow,
no trains could ever have run at all. Happily for
August, the thick wrappings in which the stove was
enveloped and the stoutness of its own make screened
him from the cold, of which, else, he must have died,—frozen.
He had still some of his loaf, and a little—a
very little—of his sausage. What he did begin to
suffer from was thirst; and this frightened him almost
mere than anything else, for Dorothea had read aloud
to them one night a story of the tortures some wrecked
men had endured because they could not find any water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
but the salt sea. It was many hours since he had last
taken a drink from the wooden spout of their old
pump, which brought them the sparkling, ice-cold
water of the hills.</p>

<p>But, fortunately for him, the stove, having been
marked and registered as “fragile and valuable,” was
not treated quite like a mere bale of goods, and the
Rosenheim station-master, who knew its consignees,
resolved to send it on by a passenger-train that would
leave there at daybreak. And when this train went
out, in it, among piles of luggage belonging to other
travellers, to Vienna, Prague, Buda-Pest, Salzburg,
was August, still undiscovered, still doubled up like
a mole in the winter under the grass. Those words,
“fragile and valuable,” had made the men lift Hirschvogel
gently and with care. He had begun to get
used to his prison, and a little used to the incessant
pounding and jumbling and rattling and shaking with
which modern travel is always accompanied, though
modern invention does deem itself so mightily clever.
All in the dark he was, and he was terribly thirsty;
but he kept feeling the earthenware sides of the Nürnberg
giant and saying, softly, “Take care of me; oh,
take care of me, dear Hirschvogel!”</p>

<p>He did not say, “Take me back;” for, now that he
was fairly out in the world, he wished to see a little of
it. He began to think that they must have been all
over the world in all this time that the rolling and
roaring and hissing and jangling had been about his
ears shut up in the dark, he began to remember all
the tales that had been told in Yule round the fire at
his grandfather’s good house at Dorf, of gnomes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
elves and subterranean terrors, and the Erl King
riding on the black horse of night, and—and—and
he began to sob and to tremble again, and this time
did scream outright. But the steam was screaming
itself so loudly that no one, had there been any one
nigh, would have heard him; and in another minute
or so the train stopped with a jar and a jerk, and he
in his cage could hear men crying aloud, “München!
München!”</p>

<p>Then he knew enough of geography to know that
he was in the heart of Bavaria. He had had an uncle
killed in the Bayerischenwald by the Bavarian forest
guards, when in the excitement of hunting a black
bear he had overpassed the limits of the Tyrol frontier.</p>

<p>That fate of his kinsman, a gallant young chamois-hunter
who had taught him to handle a trigger and
load a muzzle, made the very name of Bavaria a
terror to August.</p>

<p>“It is Bavaria! It is Bavaria!” he sobbed to the
stove; but the stove said nothing to him; it had no fire
in it. A stove can no more speak without fire than a
man can see without light. Give it fire, and it will
sing to you, tell tales to you, offer you in return all
the sympathy you ask.</p>

<p>“It is Bavaria!” sobbed August; for it is always a
name of dread augury to the Tyroleans, by reason of
those bitter struggles and midnight shots and untimely
deaths which come from those meetings of jäger and
hunter in the Bayerischenwald. But the train stopped;
Munich was reached, and August, hot and cold by
turns, and shaking like a little aspen-leaf, felt himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
once more carried out on the shoulders of men, rolled
along on a truck, and finally set down, where he knew
not, only he knew he was thirsty,—so thirsty! If
only he could have reached his hand out and scooped
up a little snow!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 431px;">
<img src="images/i-109.jpg" width="431" height="600" alt="boy opening barred window" />
<div class="caption">AUGUST OPENED THE WINDOW, CRAMMED THE SNOW INTO HIS MOUTH AGAIN AND AGAIN</div>
</div>

<p>He thought he had been moved on this truck many
miles, but in truth the stove had been only taken from
the railway-station to a shop in the Marienplatz.
Fortunately, the stove was always set upright on its
four gilded feet, an injunction to that effect having
been affixed to its written label, and on its gilded feet
it stood now in the small dark curiosity-shop of one
Hans Rhilfer.</p>

<p>“I shall not unpack it till Anton comes,” he heard
a man’s voice say; and then he heard a key grate in a
lock, and by the unbroken stillness that ensued he concluded
he was alone, and ventured to peep through the
straw and hay. What he saw was a small square room
filled with pots and pans, pictures, carvings, old blue
jugs, old steel armor, shields, daggers, Chinese idols,
Vienna china, Turkish rugs, and all the art lumber
and fabricated rubbish of a <i>bric-à-brac</i> dealer’s. It
seemed a wonderful place to him; but, oh! was there
one drop of water in it all? That was his single
thought; for his tongue was parching, and his throat
felt on fire, and his chest began to be dry and choked
as with dust. There was not a drop of water, but
there was a lattice window grated, and beyond the
window was a wide stone ledge covered with snow.
August cast one look at the locked door, darted out of
his hiding-place, ran and opened the window, crammed
the snow into his mouth again and again, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
flew back into the stove, drew the hay and straw over
the place he entered by, tied the cords, and shut the
brass door down on himself. He had brought some
big icicles in with him, and by them his thirst was
finally, if only temporarily, quenched. Then he sat
still in the bottom of the stove, listening intently, wide
awake, and once more recovering his natural boldness.</p>

<p>The thought of Dorothea kept nipping his heart
and his conscience with a hard squeeze now and then;
but he thought to himself, “If I can take her back
Hirschvogel, then how pleased she will be, and how
little ’Gilda will clap her hands!” He was not at all
selfish in his love for Hirschvogel: he wanted it for
them all at home quite as much as for himself. There
was at the bottom of his mind a kind of ache of shame
that his father—his own father—should have stripped
their hearth and sold their honor thus.</p>

<p>A robin had been perched upon a stone griffin
sculptured on a house-eave near. August had felt for
the crumbs of his loaf in his pocket, and had thrown
them to the little bird sitting so easily on the frozen
snow.</p>

<p>In the darkness where he was he now heard a little
song, made faint by the stove-wall and the window-glass
that was between him and it, but still distinct
and exquisitely sweet. It was the robin, singing after
feeding on the crumbs. August, as he heard, burst
into tears. He thought of Dorothea, who every morning
threw out some grain or some bread on the snow
before the church. “What use is it going <i>there</i>,” she
said, “if we forget the sweetest creatures God has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
made?” Poor Dorothea! Poor, good, tender, much-burdened
little soul! He thought of her till his tears
ran like rain.</p>

<p>Yet it never once occurred to him to dream of going
home. Hirschvogel was here.</p>

<p>Presently the key turned in the lock of the door;
he heard heavy footsteps and the voice of the man
who had said to his father, “You have a little mad
dog; muzzle him!” The voice said, “Ay, ay, you
have called me a fool many times. Now you shall see
what I have gotten for two hundred dirty florins.
<i>Potztausend!</i> never did <i>you</i> do such a stroke of work.”</p>

<p>Then the other voice grumbled and swore, and the
steps of the two men approached more closely, and the
heart of the child went pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, as a mouse’s
does when it is on the top of a cheese and hears a
housemaid’s broom sweeping near. They began to
strip the stove of its wrappings: that he could tell by
the noise they made with the hay and the straw. Soon
they had stripped it wholly: that, too, he knew by the
oaths and exclamations of wonder and surprise and
rapture which broke from the man who had not seen
it before.</p>

<p>“A right royal thing! A wonderful and never-to-be-rivalled
thing! Grander than the great stove of
Hohen-Salzburg! Sublime! magnificent! matchless!”</p>

<p>So the epithets ran on in thick guttural voices, diffusing
a smell of lager-beer so strong as they spoke that
it reached August crouching in his stronghold. If
they should open the door of the stove! That was
his frantic fear. If they should open it, it would be
all over with him. They would drag him out; most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
likely they would kill him, he thought, as his mother’s
young brother had been killed in the Wald.</p>

<p>The perspiration rolled off his forehead in his agony;
but he had control enough over himself to keep quiet,
and after standing by the Nürnberg master’s work for
nigh an hour, praising, marvelling, expatiating in the
lengthy German tongue, the men moved to a little
distance and began talking of sums of money and divided
profits, of which discourse he could make out no
meaning. All he could make out was that the name of
the king—the king—the king came over very often in
their arguments. He fancied at times they quarrelled,
for they swore lustily and their voices rose hoarse and
high; but after a while they seemed to pacify each other
and agree to something, and were in great glee, and so
in these merry spirits came and slapped the luminous
sides of stately Hirschvogel, and shouted to it,—</p>

<p>“Old Mumchance, you have brought us rare good
luck! To think you were smoking in a silly fool of a
salt-baker’s kitchen all these years!”</p>

<p>Then inside the stove August jumped up, with
flaming cheeks and clinching hands, and was almost on
the point of shouting out to them that they were the
thieves and should say no evil of his father, when he
remembered, just in time, that to breathe a word or
make a sound was to bring ruin on himself and sever
him forever from Hirschvogel. So he kept quite still,
and the men barred the shutters of the little lattice and
went out by the door, double-locking it after them.
He had made out from their talk that they were going
to show Hirschvogel to some great person: therefore
he kept quite still and dared not move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Muffled sounds came to him through the shutters
from the streets below,—the rolling of wheels, the
clanging of church-bells, and bursts of that military
music which is so seldom silent in the streets of Munich.
An hour perhaps passed by; sounds of steps on
the stairs kept him in perpetual apprehension. In the
intensity of his anxiety, he forgot that he was hungry
and many miles away from cheerful, Old World little
Hall, lying by the clear gray river-water, with the
ramparts of the mountains all around.</p>

<p>Presently the door opened again sharply. He could
hear the two dealers’ voices murmuring unctuous words,
in which “honor,” “gratitude,” and many fine long
noble titles played the chief parts. The voice of another
person, more clear and refined than theirs, answered
them curtly, and then, close by the Nürnberg
stove and the boy’s ear, ejaculated a single “<i>Wunderschön!</i>”
August almost lost his terror for himself in
his thrill of pride at his beloved Hirschvogel being
thus admired in the great city. He thought the master-potter
must be glad too.</p>

<p>“<i>Wunderschön!</i>” ejaculated the stranger a second
time, and then examined the stove in all its parts, read
all its mottoes, gazed long on all its devices.</p>

<p>“It must have been made for the Emperor Maximilian,”
he said at last; and the poor little boy, meanwhile,
within, was “hugged up into nothing,” as you
children say, dreading that every moment he would
open the stove. And open it truly he did, and examined
the brass-work of the door; but inside it was
so dark that crouching August passed unnoticed,
screwed up into a ball like a hedgehog as he was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
The gentleman shut to the door at length, without
having seen anything strange inside it; and then he
talked long and low with the tradesmen, and, as his
accent was different from that which August was used
to, the child could distinguish little that he said, except
the name of the king and the word “gulden” again
and again. After a while he went away, one of the
dealers accompanying him, one of them lingering behind
to bar up the shutters. Then this one also
withdrew again, double-locking the door.</p>

<p>The poor little hedgehog uncurled itself and dared
to breathe aloud.</p>

<p>What time was it?</p>

<p>Late in the day, he thought, for to accompany the
stranger they had lighted a lamp; he had heard the
scratch of the match, and through the brass fret-work
had seen the lines of light.</p>

<p>He would have to pass the night here, that was certain.
He and Hirschvogel were locked in, but at least
they were together. If only he could have had something
to eat! He thought with a pang of how at this
hour at home they ate the sweet soup, sometimes with
apples in it from Aunt Maïla’s farm orchard, and sang
together, and listened to Dorothea’s reading of little
tales, and basked in the glow and delight that had
beamed on them from the great Nürnberg fire-king.</p>

<p>“Oh, poor, poor little ’Gilda! What is she doing
without the dear Hirschvogel?” he thought. Poor
little ’Gilda! she had only now the black iron stove of
the ugly little kitchen. Oh, how cruel of father!</p>

<p>August could not bear to hear the dealers blame or
laugh at his father, but he did feel that it had been so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
so cruel to sell Hirschvogel. The mere memory of all
those long winter evenings, when they had all closed
round it, and roasted chestnuts or crab-apples in it, and
listened to the howling of the wind and the deep
sound of the church-bells, and tried very much to
make each other believe that the wolves still came
down from the mountains into the streets of Hall, and
were that very minute growling at the house door,—all
this memory coming on him with the sound of the
city bells, and the knowledge that night drew near
upon him so completely, being added to his hunger
and his fear, so overcame him that he burst out crying
for the fiftieth time since he had been inside the stove,
and felt that he would starve to death, and wondered
dreamily if Hirschvogel would care. Yes, he
was sure Hirschvogel would care. Had he not decked
it all summer long with alpine roses and edelweiss and
heaths and made it sweet with thyme and honeysuckle
and great garden-lilies? Had he ever forgotten when
Santa Claus came to make it its crown of holly and
ivy and wreathe it all around?</p>

<p>“Oh, shelter me; save me; take care of me!” he
prayed to the old fire-king, and forgot, poor little man,
that he had come on this wild-goose chase northward
to save and take care of Hirschvogel!</p>

<p>After a time he dropped asleep, as children can do
when they weep, and little robust hill-born boys most
surely do, be they where they may. It was not very
cold in this lumber-room; it was tightly shut up, and
very full of things, and at the back of it were the hot
pipes of an adjacent house, where a great deal of fuel
was burnt. Moreover, August’s clothes were warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
ones, and his blood was young. So he was not cold,
though Munich is terribly cold in the nights of December;
and he slept on and on,—which was a comfort to
him, for he forgot his woes, and his perils, and his
hunger, for a time.</p>

<p>Midnight was once more chiming from all the
brazen tongues of the city when he awoke, and, all
being still around him, ventured to put his head out of
the brass door of the stove to see why such a strange
bright light was round him.</p>

<p>It was a very strange and brilliant light indeed;
and yet, what is perhaps still stranger, it did not
frighten or amaze him, nor did what he saw alarm
him either, and yet I think it would have done you or
me. For what he saw was nothing less than all the
<i>bric-à-brac</i> in motion.</p>

<p>A big jug, an Apostel-Krug, of Kruessen, was solemnly
dancing a minuet with a plump Faenza jar; a
tall Dutch clock was going through a gavotte with a
spindle-legged ancient chair; a very droll porcelain
figure of Littenhausen was bowing to a very stiff soldier
in <i>terre cuite</i> of Ulm; an old violin of Cremona
was playing itself, and a queer little shrill plaintive
music that thought itself merry came from a painted
spinnet covered with faded roses; some gilt Spanish
leather had got up on the wall and laughed; a Dresden
mirror was tripping about, crowned with flowers, and a
Japanese bonze was riding along on a griffin; a slim
Venetian rapier had come to blows with a stout Ferrara
sabre, all about a little pale-faced chit of a damsel
in white Nymphenburg china; and a portly Franconian
pitcher in <i>grès gris</i> was calling aloud, “Oh, these Italians!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
always at feud!” But nobody listened to him
at all. A great number of little Dresden cups and
saucers were all skipping and waltzing; the teapots,
with their broad round faces, were spinning their own
lids like teetotums; the high-backed gilded chairs were
having a game of cards together; and a little Saxe
poodle, with a blue ribbon at its throat, was running
from one to another, whilst a yellow cat of Cornelis
Lachtleven’s rode about on a Delft horse in blue pottery
of 1489. Meanwhile the brilliant light shed on
the scene came from three silver candelabra, though
they had no candles set up in them; and, what is the
greatest miracle of all, August looked on at these mad
freaks and felt no sensation of wonder! He only, as
he heard the violin and the spinnet playing, felt an
irresistible desire to dance too.</p>

<p>No doubt his face said what he wished; for a
lovely little lady, all in pink and gold and white, with
powdered hair, and high-heeled shoes, and all made
of the very finest and fairest Meissen china, tripped up
to him, and smiled, and gave him her hand, and led
him out to a minuet. And he danced it perfectly,—poor
little August in his thick, clumsy shoes, and his
thick, clumsy sheepskin jacket, and his rough home-spun
linen, and his broad Tyrolean hat! He must
have danced it perfectly, this dance of kings and queens
in days when crowns were duly honored, for the lovely
lady always smiled benignly and never scolded him at
all, and danced so divinely herself to the stately measures
the spinnet was playing that August could not
take his eyes off her till, their minuet ended, she sat
down on her own white-and-gold bracket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am the Princess of Saxe-Royale,” she said to
him, with a benignant smile; “and you have got
through that minuet very fairly.”</p>

<p>Then he ventured to say to her,—</p>

<p>“Madame my princess, could you tell me kindly
why some of the figures and furniture dance and speak,
and some lie up in a corner like lumber? It does
make me curious. Is it rude to ask?”</p>

<p>For it greatly puzzled him why, when some of the
<i>bric-à-brac</i> was all full of life and motion, some was
quite still and had not a single thrill in it.</p>

<p>“My dear child,” said the powdered lady, “is it
possible that you do not know the reason? Why,
those silent, dull things are <i>imitation!</i>”</p>

<p>This she said with so much decision that she evidently
considered it a condensed but complete answer.</p>

<p>“Imitation?” repeated August, timidly, not understanding.</p>

<p>“Of course! Lies, falsehoods, fabrications!” said
the princess in pink shoes, very vivaciously. “They
only <i>pretend</i> to be what we <i>are!</i> They never wake
up: how can they? No imitation ever had any soul in
it yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said August, humbly, not even sure that he
understood entirely yet. He looked at Hirschvogel:
surely it had a royal soul within it: would it not wake
up and speak? Oh dear! how he longed to hear the
voice of his fire-king! And he began to forget that
he stood by a lady who sat upon a pedestal of gold-and-white
china, with the year 1746 cut on it, and the
Meissen mark.</p>

<p>“What will you be when you are a man?” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
little lady, sharply, for her black eyes were quick
though her red lips were smiling. “Will you work
for the <i>Königliche Porcellan-Manufactur</i>, like my great
dead Kandler?”</p>

<p>“I have never thought,” said August, stammering;
“at least—that is—I do wish—I do hope to be a
painter, as was Master Augustin Hirschvogel at Nürnberg.”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” said all the real <i>bric-à-brac</i> in one breath,
and the two Italian rapiers left off fighting to cry,
“<i>Benone!</i>” For there is not a bit of true <i>bric-à-brac</i>
in all Europe that does not know the names of the
mighty masters.</p>

<p>August felt quite pleased to have won so much
applause, and grew as red as the lady’s shoes with
bashful contentment.</p>

<p>“I knew all the Hirschvögel, from old Veit downwards,”
said a fat <i>grès de Flandre</i> beer-jug: “I myself
was made at Nürnberg.” And he bowed to the great
stove very politely, taking off his own silver hat—I
mean lid—with a courtly sweep that he could scarcely
have learned from burgomasters. The stove, however,
was silent, and a sickening suspicion (for what is such
heart-break as a suspicion of what we love?) came
through the mind of August: <i>Was Hirschvogel only
imitation?</i></p>

<p>“No, no, no, no!” he said to himself, stoutly: though
Hirschvogel never stirred, never spoke, yet would he
keep all faith in it. After all their happy years together,
after all the nights of warmth and joy he owed
it, should he doubt his own friend and hero, whose
gilt lion’s feet he had kissed in his babyhood? “No,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
no, no, no!” he said, again, with so much emphasis
that the Lady of Meissen looked sharply again at him.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, with pretty disdain; “no, believe
me, they may ‘pretend’ forever. They can never look
like us! They imitate even our marks, but never can
they look like the real thing, never can they <i>chassent
de race</i>.”</p>

<p>“How should they?” said a bronze statuette of
Vischer’s. “They daub themselves green with verdigris,
or sit out in the rain to get rusted; but green
and rust are not <i>patina;</i> only the ages can give that!”</p>

<p>“And <i>my</i> imitations are all in primary colors, staring
colors, hot as the colors of a hostelry’s sign-board!”
said the Lady of Meissen, with a shiver.</p>

<p>“Well, there is a <i>grès de Flandre</i> over there, who
pretends to be a Hans Kraut, as I am,” said the jug
with the silver hat, pointing with his handle to a jug
that lay prone on its side in a corner. “He has copied
me as exactly as it is given to moderns to copy us.
Almost he might be mistaken for me. But yet what
a difference there is! How crude are his blues! how
evidently done over the glaze are his black letters!
He has tried to give himself my very twist; but what
a lamentable exaggeration of that playful deviation in
my lines which in his becomes actual deformity!”</p>

<p>“And look at that,” said the gilt Cordovan leather,
with a contemptuous glance at a broad piece of gilded
leather spread out on a table. “They will sell him
cheek by jowl with me, and give him my name; but
look! <i>I</i> am overlaid with pure gold beaten thin as a
film and laid on me in absolute honesty by worthy
Diego de las Gorgias, worker in leather of lovely Cordova<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
in the blessed reign of Ferdinand the Most
Christian. <i>His</i> gilding is one part gold to eleven
other parts of brass and rubbish, and it has been laid
on him with a brush—<i>a brush!</i>—pah! of course he
will be as black as a crock in a few years’ time, whilst
I am as bright as when I first was made, and, unless I
am burnt as my Cordova burnt its heretics, I shall
shine on forever.”</p>

<p>“They carve pear-wood because it is so soft, and dye
it brown, and call it <i>me!</i>” said an old oak cabinet, with
a chuckle.</p>

<p>“That is not so painful; it does not vulgarize you
so much as the cups they paint to-day and christen
after <i>me!</i>” said a Carl Theodor cup subdued in hue,
yet gorgeous as a jewel.</p>

<p>“Nothing can be so annoying as to see common
gimcracks aping <i>me!</i>” interposed the princess in the
pink shoes.</p>

<p>“They even steal my motto, though it is Scripture,”
said a <i>Trauerkrug</i> of Regensburg in black-and-white.</p>

<p>“And my own dots they put on plain English china
creatures!” sighed the little white maid of Nymphenburg.</p>

<p>“And they sell hundreds and thousands of common
china plates, calling them after me, and baking my
saints and my legends in a muffle of to-day; it is blasphemy!”
said a stout plate of Gubbio, which in its
year of birth had seen the face of Maestro Giorgio.</p>

<p>“That is what is so terrible in these <i>bric-à-brac</i>
places,” said the princess of Meissen. “It brings one
in contact with such low, imitative creatures; one really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
is safe nowhere nowadays unless under glass at the
Louvre or South Kensington.”</p>

<p>“And they get even there,” sighed the <i>grès de Flandre</i>.
“A terrible thing happened to a dear friend of
mine, a <i>terre cuite</i> of Blasius (you know the <i>terres cuites</i>
of Blasius date from 1560). Well, he was put under
glass in a museum that shall be nameless, and he found
himself set next to his own imitation born and baked
yesterday at Frankfort, and what think you the miserable
creature said to him, with a grin? ‘Old Pipe-clay,’—that
is what he called my friend,—‘the fellow
that bought <i>me</i> got just as much commission on me as
the fellow that bought <i>you</i>, and that was all that <i>he</i>
thought about. You know it is only the public money
that goes!’ And the horrid creature grinned again till
he actually cracked himself. There is a Providence
above all things, even museums.”</p>

<p>“Providence might have interfered before, and saved
the public money,” said the little Meissen lady with
the pink shoes.</p>

<p>“After all, does it matter?” said a Dutch jar of
Haarlem. “All the shamming in the world will not
<i>make</i> them us!”</p>

<p>“One does not like to be vulgarized,” said the Lady
of Meissen, angrily.</p>

<p>“My maker, the Krabbetje,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> did not trouble his
head about that,” said the Haarlem jar, proudly. “The
Krabbetje made me for the kitchen, the bright, clean,
snow-white Dutch kitchen, wellnigh three centuries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>ago, and now I am thought worthy the palace; yet I
wish I were at home; yes, I wish I could see the good
Dutch vrouw, and the shining canals, and the great
green meadows dotted with the kine.”</p>

<p>“Ah! if we could all go back to our makers!”
sighed the Gubbio plate, thinking of Giorgio Andreoli
and the glad and gracious days of the Renaissance: and
somehow the words touched the frolicsome souls of the
dancing jars, the spinning teapots, the chairs that were
playing cards; and the violin stopped its merry music
with a sob, and the spinnet sighed,—thinking of dead
hands.</p>

<p>Even the little Saxe poodle howled for a master forever
lost; and only the swords went on quarrelling,
and made such a clattering noise that the Japanese
bonze rode at them on his monster and knocked them
both right over, and they lay straight and still, looking
foolish, and the little Nymphenburg maid, though she
was crying, smiled and almost laughed.</p>

<p>Then from where the great stove stood there came a
solemn voice.</p>

<p>All eyes turned upon Hirschvogel, and the heart of
its little human comrade gave a great jump of joy.</p>

<p>“My friends,” said that clear voice from the turret
of Nürnberg faïence, “I have listened to all you have
said. There is too much talking among the Mortalities
whom one of themselves has called the Windbags.
Let not us be like them. I hear among men so much
vain speech, so much precious breath and precious time
wasted in empty boasts, foolish anger, useless reiteration,
blatant argument ignoble mouthings, that I have
learned to deem speech a curse, laid on man to weaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and envenom all his undertakings. For over two
hundred years I have never spoken myself: you, I
hear, are not so reticent. I only speak now because
one of you said a beautiful thing that touched me. If
we all might but go back to our makers! Ah, yes!
if we might! We were made in days when even men
were true creatures, and so we, the work of their hands,
were true too. We, the begotten of ancient days, derive
all the value in us from the fact that our makers
wrought at us with zeal, with piety, with integrity,
with faith,—not to win fortunes or to glut a market,
but to do nobly an honest thing and create for the
honor of the Arts and God. I see amidst you a little
human thing who loves me, and in his own ignorant
childish way loves Art. Now, I want him forever to
remember this night and these words; to remember
that we are what we are, and precious in the eyes of
the world, because centuries ago those who were of
single mind and of pure hand so created us, scorning
sham and haste and counterfeit. Well do I recollect
my master, Augustin Hirschvogel. He led a wise and
blameless life, and wrought in loyalty and love, and
made his time beautiful thereby, like one of his own
rich, many-colored church casements, that told holy
tales as the sun streamed through them. Ah, yes, my
friends, to go back to our masters!—that would be the
best that could befall us. But they are gone, and even
the perishable labors of their lives outlive them. For
many, many years I, once honored of emperors, dwelt
in a humble house and warmed in successive winters
three generations of little, cold, hungry children.
When I warmed them they forgot that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
hungry; they laughed and told tales, and slept at last
about my feet. Then I knew that humble as had
become my lot it was one that my master would have
wished for me, and I was content. Sometimes a tired
woman would creep up to me, and smile because she
was near me, and point out my golden crown or my
ruddy fruit to a baby in her arms. That was better
than to stand in a great hall of a great city, cold and
empty, even though wise men came to gaze and throngs
of fools gaped, passing with flattering words. Where
I go now I know not; but since I go from that humble
house where they loved me, I shall be sad and alone.
They pass so soon,—those fleeting mortal lives! Only
we endure,—we, the things that the human brain creates.
We can but bless them a little as they glide by: if we
have done that, we have done what our masters wished.
So in us our masters, being dead, yet may speak and
live.”</p>

<p>Then the voice sank away in silence, and a strange
golden light that had shone on the great stove faded
away; so also the light died down in the silver candelabra.
A soft, pathetic melody stole gently through
the room. It came from the old, old spinnet that was
covered with the faded roses.</p>

<p>Then that sad, sighing music of a bygone day died
too; the clocks of the city struck six of the morning;
day was rising over the Bayerischenwald. August
awoke with a great start, and found himself lying on
the bare bricks of the floor of the chamber, and all the
<i>bric-à-brac</i> was lying quite still all around. The
pretty Lady of Meissen was motionless on her porcelain
bracket, and the little Saxe poodle was quiet at her side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>He rose slowly to his feet. He was very cold, but
he was not sensible of it or of the hunger that was
gnawing his little empty entrails. He was absorbed
in the wondrous sight, in the wondrous sounds, that
he had seen and heard.</p>

<p>All was dark around him. Was it still midnight or
had morning come? Morning, surely; for against the
barred shutters he heard the tiny song of the robin.</p>

<p>Tramp, tramp, too, came a heavy step up the stair.
He had but a moment in which to scramble back into
the interior of the great stove, when the door opened
and the two dealers entered, bringing burning candles
with them to see their way.</p>

<p>August was scarcely conscious of danger more than
he was of cold or hunger. A marvellous sense of
courage, of security, of happiness, was about him, like
strong and gentle arms enfolding him and lifting him
upwards—upwards—upwards! Hirschvogel would
defend him.</p>

<p>The dealers undid the shutters, scaring the red-breast
away, and then tramped about in their heavy
boots and chattered in contented voices, and began to
wrap up the stove once more in all its straw and hay
and cordage.</p>

<p>It never once occurred to them to glance inside.
Why should they look inside a stove that they had
bought and were about to sell again for all its glorious
beauty of exterior?</p>

<p>The child still did not feel afraid. A great exaltation
had come to him: he was like one lifted up by
his angels.</p>

<p>Presently the two traders called up their porters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and the stove, heedfully swathed and wrapped and
tended as though it were some sick prince going on a
journey, was borne on the shoulders of six stout Bavarians
down the stairs and out of the door into the
Marienplatz. Even behind all those wrappings August
felt the icy bite of the intense cold of the outer air at
dawn of a winter’s day in Munich. The men moved
the stove with exceeding gentleness and care, so that
he had often been far more roughly shaken in his big
brothers’ arms than he was in his journey now; and
though both hunger and thirst made themselves felt,
being foes that will take no denial, he was still in that
state of nervous exaltation which deadens all physical
suffering and is at once a cordial and an opiate. He
had heard Hirschvogel speak; that was enough.</p>

<p>The stout carriers tramped through the city, six of
them, with the Nürnberg fire-castle on their brawny
shoulders, and went right across Munich to the railway-station,
and August in the dark recognized all
the ugly, jangling, pounding, roaring, hissing railway-noises,
and thought, despite his courage and excitement,
“Will it be a <i>very</i> long journey?” For his stomach
had at times an odd sinking sensation, and his head
sadly often felt light and swimming. If it was a very,
very long journey he felt half afraid that he would be
dead or something bad before the end, and Hirschvogel
would be so lonely: that was what he thought
most about; not much about himself, and not much
about Dorothea and the house at home. He was
“high strung to high emprise,” and could not look
behind him.</p>

<p>Whether for a long or a short journey, whether for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
weal or woe, the stove with August still within it was
once more hoisted up into a great van; but this time it
was not all alone, and the two dealers as well as the
six porters were all with it.</p>

<p>He in his darkness knew that; for he heard their
voices. The train glided away over the Bavarian
plain southward; and he heard the men say something
of Berg and the Wurm-See, but their German
was strange to him, and he could not make out what
these names meant.</p>

<p>The train rolled on, with all its fume and fuss, and
roar of steam, and stench of oil and burning coal. It
had to go quietly and slowly on account of the snow
which was falling, and which had fallen all night.</p>

<p>“He might have waited till he came to the city,”
grumbled one man to another. “What weather to
stay on at Berg!”</p>

<p>But who he was that stayed on at Berg, August
could not make out at all.</p>

<p>Though the men grumbled about the state of the
roads and the season, they were hilarious and well content,
for they laughed often, and, when they swore, did
so good-humoredly, and promised their porters fine
presents at New-Year; and August, like a shrewd
little boy as he was, who even in the secluded Innthal
had learned that money is the chief mover of men’s
mirth, thought to himself, with a terrible pang,—</p>

<p>“They have sold Hirschvogel for some great sum!
They have sold him already!”</p>

<p>Then his heart grew faint and sick within him, for
he knew very well that he must soon die, shut up
without food and water thus; and what new owner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the great fire-palace would ever permit him to dwell
in it?</p>

<p>“Never mind; I <i>will</i> die,” thought he; “and Hirschvogel
will know it.”</p>

<p>Perhaps you think him a very foolish little fellow;
but I do not.</p>

<p>It is always good to be loyal and ready to endure to
the end.</p>

<p>It is but an hour and a quarter that the train usually
takes to pass from Munich to the Wurm-See or Lake
of Starnberg; but this morning the journey was much
slower, because the way was encumbered by snow.
When it did reach Possenhofen and stop, and the
Nürnberg stove was lifted out once more, August
could see through the fret-work of the brass door, as
the stove stood upright facing the lake, that this
Wurm-See was a calm and noble piece of water, of
great width, with low wooded banks and distant mountains,
a peaceful, serene place, full of rest.</p>

<p>It was now near ten o’clock. The sun had come
forth; there was a clear gray sky hereabouts; the snow
was not falling, though it lay white and smooth everywhere,
down to the edge of the water, which before
long would itself be ice.</p>

<p>Before he had time to get more than a glimpse of
the green gliding surface, the stove was again lifted
up and placed on a large boat that was in waiting,—one
of those very long and huge boats which the
women in these parts use as laundries, and the men as
timber-rafts. The stove, with much labor and much
expenditure of time and care, was hoisted into this,
and August would have grown sick and giddy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the heaving and falling if his big brothers had not
long used him to such tossing about, so that he was as
much at ease head, as feet, downward. The stove
once in it safely with its guardians, the big boat moved
across the lake to Leoni. How a little hamlet on a
Bavarian lake got that Tuscan-sounding name I cannot
tell; but Leoni it is. The big boat was a long
time crossing: the lake here is about three miles broad,
and these heavy barges are unwieldy and heavy to
move, even though they are towed and tugged at from
the shore.</p>

<p>“If we should be too late!” the two dealers muttered
to each other, in agitation and alarm. “He said
eleven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Who was he?” thought August; “the buyer, of
course, of Hirschvogel.” The slow passage across the
Wurm-See was accomplished at length: the lake was
placid; there was a sweet calm in the air and on the
water; there was a great deal of snow in the sky,
though the sun was shining and gave a solemn hush
to the atmosphere. Boats and one little steamer were
going up and down; in the clear frosty light the distant
mountains of Zillerthal and the Algau Alps were
visible; market-people, cloaked and furred, went by on
the water or on the banks; the deep woods of the
shores were black and gray and brown. Poor August
could see nothing of a scene that would have delighted
him; as the stove was now set, he could only see the
old worm eaten wood of the huge barge.</p>

<p>Presently they touched the pier at Leoni.</p>

<p>“Now men, for a stout mile and half! You shall
drink your reward at Christmas-time,” said one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
dealers to his porters, who, stout, strong men as they
were, showed a disposition to grumble at their task.
Encouraged by large promises, they shouldered sullenly
the Nürnberg stove, grumbling again at its preposterous
weight, but little dreaming that they carried within it a
small, panting, trembling boy; for August began to
tremble now that he was about to see the future owner
of Hirschvogel.</p>

<p>“If he look a good, kind man,” he thought, “I will
beg him to let me stay with it.”</p>

<p>The porters began their toilsome journey, and moved
off from the village pier. He could see nothing, for
the brass door was over his head, and all that gleamed
through it was the clear gray sky. He had been tilted
on to his back, and if he had not been a little mountaineer,
used to hanging head-downwards over crevasses,
and, moreover, seasoned to rough treatment by the
hunters and guides of the hills and the salt-workers in
the town, he would have been made ill and sick by the
bruising and shaking and many changes of position to
which he had been subjected.</p>

<p>The way the men took was a mile and a half in
length, but the road was heavy with snow, and the
burden they bore was heavier still. The dealers
cheered them on, swore at them and praised them in
one breath; besought them and reiterated their splendid
promises, for a clock was striking eleven, and they
had been ordered to reach their destination at that
hour, and, though the air was so cold, the heat-drops
rolled off their foreheads as they walked, they were so
frightened at being late. But the porters would not
budge a foot quicker than they chose, and as they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
not poor four-footed carriers their employers dared
not thrash them, though most willingly would they
have done so.</p>

<p>The road seemed terribly long to the anxious tradesmen,
to the plodding porters, to the poor little man inside
the stove, as he kept sinking and rising, sinking
and rising, with each of their steps.</p>

<p>Where they were going he had no idea, only after
a very long time he lost the sense of the fresh icy wind
blowing on his face through the brass-work above, and
felt by their movements beneath him that they were
mounting steps or stairs. Then he heard a great many
different voices, but he could not understand what was
being said. He felt that his bearers paused some time,
then moved on and on again. Their feet went so softly
he thought they must be moving on carpet, and as he
felt a warm air come to him he concluded that he was
in some heated chambers, for he was a clever little fellow,
and could put two and two together, though he
was so hungry and so thirsty and his empty stomach
felt so strangely. They must have gone, he thought,
through some very great number of rooms, for they
walked so long on and on, on and on. At last the
stove was set down again, and, happily for him, set so
that his feet were downward.</p>

<p>What he fancied was that he was in some museum,
like that which he had seen in the city of Innspruck.</p>

<p>The voices he heard were very hushed, and the steps
seemed to go away, far away, leaving him alone with
Hirschvogel. He dared not look out, but he peeped
through the brass-work, and all he could see was a big
carved lion’s head in ivory, with a gold crown atop. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
belonged to a velvet fauteuil, but he could not see the
chair, only the ivory lion.</p>

<p>There was a delicious fragrance in the air,—a fragrance
as of flowers. “Only how can it be flowers?”
thought August. “It is November!”</p>

<p>From afar off, as it seemed, there came a dreamy,
exquisite music, as sweet as the spinnet’s had been, but
so much fuller, so much richer, seeming as though a
chorus of angels were singing all together. August
ceased to think of the museum: he thought of heaven.
“Are we gone to the Master?” he thought, remembering
the words of Hirschvogel.</p>

<p>All was so still around him; there was no sound
anywhere except the sound of the far-off choral music.</p>

<p>He did not know it, but he was in the royal castle
of Berg, and the music he heard was the music of
Wagner, who was playing in a distant room some of
the motives of “Parsival.”</p>

<p>Presently he heard a fresh step near him, and he
heard a low voice say, close behind him, “So!” An
exclamation no doubt, he thought, of admiration and
wonder at the beauty of Hirschvogel.</p>

<p>Then the same voice said, after a long pause, during
which no doubt, as August thought, this new-comer
was examining all the details of the wondrous fire-tower,
“It was well bought; it is exceedingly beautiful!
It is most undoubtedly the work of Augustin
Hirschvogel.”</p>

<p>Then the hand of the speaker turned the round
handle of the brass door, and the fainting soul of the
poor little prisoner within grew sick with fear.</p>

<p>The handle turned, the door was slowly drawn open,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
some one bent down and looked in, and the same voice
that he had heard in praise of its beauty called aloud,
in surprise, “What is this in it? A live child!”</p>

<p>Then August, terrified beyond all self-control, and
dominated by one master-passion, sprang out of the
body of the stove and fell at the feet of the speaker.</p>

<p>“Oh, let me stay! Pray, meinherr, let me stay!”
he sobbed. “I have come all the way with Hirschvogel!”</p>

<p>Some gentlemen’s hands seized him, not gently by
any means, and their lips angrily muttered in his ear,
“Little knave, peace! be quiet! hold your tongue!
It is the king!”</p>

<p>They were about to drag him out of the august atmosphere
as if he had been some venomous, dangerous
beast come there to slay, but the voice he had heard
speak of the stove said, in kind accents, “Poor little
child! he is very young. Let him go: let him speak
to me.”</p>

<p>The word of a king is law to his courtiers: so, sorely
against their wish, the angry and astonished chamberlains
let August slide out of their grasp, and he
stood there in his little rough sheepskin coat and his
thick, mud-covered boots, with his curling hair all in
a tangle, in the midst of the most beautiful chamber he
had ever dreamed of, and in the presence of a young
man with a beautiful dark face, and eyes full of dreams
and fire; and the young man said to him,—</p>

<p>“My child, how came you here, hidden in this
stove? Be not afraid: tell me the truth. I am the
king.”</p>

<p>August in an instinct of homage cast his great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
battered black hat with the tarnished gold tassels down
on the floor of the room, and folded his little brown
hands in supplication. He was too intensely in earnest
to be in any way abashed; he was too lifted out of
himself by his love for Hirschvogel to be conscious of
any awe before any earthly majesty. He was only so
glad—so glad it was the king. Kings were always
kind; so the Tyrolese think, who love their lords.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear king!” he said, with trembling entreaty
in his faint little voice, “Hirschvogel was ours, and we
have loved it all our lives; and father sold it. And
when I saw that it did really go from us, then I said
to myself I would go with it; and I have come all the
way inside it. And last night it spoke and said beautiful
things. And I do pray you to let me live with it,
and I will go out every morning and cut wood for it
and you, if only you will let me stay beside it. No
one ever has fed it with fuel but me since I grew big
enough, and it loves me;—it does indeed; it said so
last night; and it said that it had been happier with us
than if it were in any palace——”</p>

<p>And then his breath failed him, and, as he lifted his
little, eager, pale face to the young king’s, great tears
were falling down his cheeks.</p>

<p>Now, the king likes all poetic and uncommon things,
and there was that in the child’s face which pleased and
touched him. He motioned to his gentlemen to leave
the little boy alone.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” he asked him.</p>

<p>“I am August Strehla. My father is Hans Strehla.
We live in Hall in the Innthal; and Hirschvogel has
been ours so long,—so long!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>His lips quivered with a broken sob.</p>

<p>“And have you truly travelled inside this stove all
the way from Tyrol?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said August; “no one thought to look inside
till you did.”</p>

<p>The king laughed; then another view of the matter
occurred to him.</p>

<p>“Who bought the stove of your father?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Traders of Munich,” said August, who did not know
that he ought not to have spoken to the king as to a
simple citizen, and whose little brain was whirling and
spinning dizzily round its one central idea.</p>

<p>“What sum did they pay your father, do you know?”
asked the sovereign.</p>

<p>“Two hundred florins,” said August, with a great
sigh of shame. “It was so much money, and he is so
poor, and there are so many of us.”</p>

<p>The king turned to his gentlemen-in-waiting. “Did
these dealers of Munich come with the stove.”</p>

<p>He was answered in the affirmative. He desired
them to be sought for and brought before him. As one
of his chamberlains hastened on the errand, the monarch
looked at August with compassion.</p>

<p>“You are very pale, little fellow: when did you eat
last?”</p>

<p>“I had some bread and sausage with me; yesterday
afternoon I finished it.”</p>

<p>“You would like to eat now?”</p>

<p>“If I might have a little water I would be glad;
my throat is very dry.”</p>

<p>The king had water and wine brought for him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
cake also; but August, though he drank eagerly, could
not swallow anything. His mind was in too great a
tumult.</p>

<p>“May I stay with Hirschvogel?—may I stay?” he
said, with feverish agitation.</p>

<p>“Wait a little,” said the king, and asked, abruptly,
“What do you wish to be when you are a man?”</p>

<p>“A painter. I wish to be what Hirschvogel was,—I
mean the master that made my Hirschvogel.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” said the king.</p>

<p>Then the two dealers were brought into their sovereign’s
presence. They were so terribly alarmed, not
being either so innocent or so ignorant as August was,
that they were trembling as though they were being led
to the slaughter, and they were so utterly astonished
too at a child having come all the way from Tyrol in
the stove, as a gentleman of the court had just told
them this child had done, that they could not tell what
to say or where to look, and presented a very foolish
aspect indeed.</p>

<p>“Did you buy this Nürnberg stove of this little
boy’s father for two hundred florins?” the king asked
them; and his voice was no longer soft and kind as it
had been when addressing the child, but very stern.</p>

<p>“Yes, your majesty,” murmured the trembling
traders.</p>

<p>“And how much did the gentleman who purchased
it for me give to you?”</p>

<p>“Two thousand ducats, your majesty,” muttered the
dealers, frightened out of their wits, and telling the
truth in their fright.</p>

<p>The gentleman was not present: he was a trusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
counsellor in art matters of the king’s, and often made
purchases for him.</p>

<p>The king smiled a little, and said nothing. The
gentleman had made out the price to him as eleven
thousand ducats.</p>

<p>“You will give at once to this boy’s father the two
thousand gold ducats that you received, less the two
hundred Austrian florins that you paid him,” said the
king to his humiliated and abject subjects. “You are
great rogues. Be thankful you are not more greatly
punished.”</p>

<p>He dismissed them by a sign to his courtiers, and to
one of these gave the mission of making the dealers
of the Marienplatz disgorge their ill-gotten gains.</p>

<p>August heard, and felt dazzled yet miserable. Two
thousand gold Bavarian ducats for his father! Why,
his father would never need to go any more to the salt-baking!
And yet, whether for ducats or for florins,
Hirschvogel was sold just the same, and would the
king let him stay with it?—would he?</p>

<p>“Oh, do! oh, please do!” he murmured, joining his
little brown weather-stained hands, and kneeling down
before the young monarch, who himself stood absorbed
in painful thought, for the deception so basely practised
for the greedy sake of gain on him by a trusted counsellor
was bitter to him.</p>

<p>He looked down on the child, and as he did so
smiled once more.</p>

<p>“Rise up, my little man,” he said, in a kind voice;
“kneel only to your God. Will I let you stay with
your Hirschvogel? Yes, I will; you shall stay at my
court, and you shall be taught to be a painter,—in oils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
or on porcelain as you will,—and you must grow up
worthily, and win all the laurels at our Schools of Art,
and if when you are twenty-one years old you have
done well and bravely, then I will give you your
Nürnberg stove, or, if I am no more living, then those
who reign after me shall do so. And now go away
with this gentleman, and be not afraid, and you shall
light a fire every morning in Hirschvogel, but you will
not need to go out and cut the wood.”</p>

<p>Then he smiled and stretched out his hand; the
courtiers tried to make August understand that he
ought to bow and touch it with his lips, but August
could not understand that anyhow; he was too happy.
He threw his two arms about the king’s knees, and
kissed his feet passionately; then he lost all sense of
where he was, and fainted away from hunger, and tire,
and emotion, and wondrous joy.</p>

<p>As the darkness of his swoon closed in on him,
he heard in his fancy the voice from Hirschvogel
saying,—</p>

<p>“Let us be worthy our maker!”</p>

<p>He is only a scholar yet, but he is a happy scholar,
and promises to be a great man. Sometimes he goes
back for a few days to Hall, where the gold ducats
have made his father prosperous. In the old house-room
there is a large white porcelain stove of Munich,
the king’s gift to Dorothea and ’Gilda.</p>

<p>And August never goes home without going into
the great church and saying his thanks to God, who
blessed his strange winter’s journey in the Nürnberg
stove. As for his dream in the dealers’ room that
night, he will never admit that he did dream it; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
still declares that he saw it all, and heard the voice of
Hirschvogel. And who shall say that he did not? for
what is the gift of the poet and the artist except to see
the sights which others cannot see and to hear the sounds
that others cannot hear?</p>

<h2>IN THE APPLE-COUNTRY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in one of the green lanes of South Devonshire
that Gemma, being quite tired out, threw herself down
on the daisied grass and said to her grandfather,—</p>

<p>“Nonno, let us rest a little and eat.” Her grandfather
said to her,—</p>

<p>“<i>Carina mia</i>, I would eat gladly, but we have
nothing to eat. The satchel is empty.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i-145.jpg" width="600" height="426" alt="two children and an older man sitting on the side of the road" />
<div class="caption">“LET US REST A LITTLE AND EAT”</div>
</div>

<p>Gemma, lying chest downward on the turf, sighed,
and buried her hands in her abundant curls and cooled
her forehead on the damp grass. She was just thirteen
years old, and she was so pretty that she made the heart
of the old grandfather ache often when he looked at
her and thought that she would most likely soon be
left alone in the world, for her little brother Bindo
could not be said to count for anything, being only ten
years old. Gemma was very lovely indeed, being tall
and lithe and gay, and full of grace, and having a beautiful
changeable face, all light and color. But she was
only thirteen, and all she could do to get her livelihood
was to dance the <i>saltarello</i> and the <i>tarantella</i>. She and
her brother danced, which they did very prettily, and
the old man whom they called Nonno told fortunes
and performed some simple conjuring tricks, and these
were all bad trades as times went, for nowadays nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
amuses himself with simple things, and the rural folk
have grown as sharp and as serious as the city people,
which to my thinking is a very great loss to the world,
for merry people are generally kind people, and contented
people are easily governed, and have no appetites
for politics and philosophies and the like indigestible
things.</p>

<p>Nonno and Gemma and Bindo were merry enough
even on empty stomachs. The old man was as simple
as a duck, and as gentle as a rabbit, and was rather
more of a child than either of the children. Bindo
was a little, round, playful, gleeful thing, like a little
field-mouse, and Gemma was as gay as a lark, though
she had to bear the burden of the only brains that there
were in the family.</p>

<p>They were little Neapolitans; they had been born in
a little cabin on the sunny shore facing Ischia, and in
their infancy had tumbled about naked and glad as
young dolphins in the bright blue waters. Then their
parents had died,—their father at sea, their mother of
fever,—and left them to the care of Nonno; Nonno,
who was very old, so old that they thought he must
have been made almost before the world itself, and who,
after having been a showman of puppets to divert the
poorest classes all his life, was so very poor himself then
that he could hardly scrape enough together to get a
little drink of thin wine and an inch or two of polenta.
Being so very poor, he was seduced into accepting an engagement
for himself and the children with a wicked man
whose business it was in life to decoy poor little Italians
and make money out of them in foreign lands. Nonno
was so good and simple himself that he thought everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
was as harmless as he was, and his grief and
amazement were very great when on reaching the
English shores with this wicked man he found that
the wicked man meant to give him the slip altogether
and go off with the two children. By a mere hazard,
Nonno, whose name was Epifania Santo (a droll name,
but he himself had been a foundling), was able to
defeat the wicked man so far that he got out of his
clutches and took his grandchildren with him. But
there they all three were in England, with no money
at all, and nothing on earth but a few puppets, and a
conjurer’s box of playthings, and the stilts on which
the wicked man had had the children taught to walk.
And in England they had now been four years, remaining
there chiefly because they had no notion how
to get home again, and partly because Nonno had such
a great terror of the sea. He had suffered so much on
the long voyage into which he had been entrapped from
Naples, round by the Bay of Biscay up the Bristol
Channel, that he would sooner have died there and
then than have set foot again on board a sea-going
vessel. So in England they had stayed, wandering
about and picking up a few pence in villages and towns,
and clinging together tenderly, and being very often
hungry, cold, tired, roofless, but yet being all the while
happy.</p>

<p>Sometimes, too, they fared well: the children’s brilliant
uncommon beauty and pretty foreign accent often
touched country-people’s hearts, and sometimes they
would get bed and board at homely farm-houses high
on lonely hills, or be made welcome without payment
in little wayside inns. They had kept to the southwest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
part of the kingdom, never being able to afford
other means of locomotion than their own feet, and the
farthest distance they had ever compassed had been
this far-south country-side, where the green woods and
pastures roll down to the broad estuaries of Exe and
Dart. This green, wet, shadowy country always seemed
strange to the children; for a long while they thought
it was always evening in England. They could remember
the long sunshiny years at home, and the radiant
air, and the blue, clear sky, and the sea that
seemed always laughing. They could never forget it
indeed, and when they were together they never talked
of anything else: only the cactus-fruit and the green
and black figs, the red tomatoes and the rough pomegranates,
and the big balls of gold to be had in the
orange woods just for the plucking; the boats with the
pretty striped sails, and the villas with the marbles and
the palms, and the islands all aglow in the sunset, and
the distance you could see looking away, away, away
into the immeasurable azure of the air. Oh, yes, they
remembered it all, and at night they would weep for it,
the old man’s slow salt tears mingling with the passionate
rain of the childish eyes. Here it was green
and pretty in its own way, but all so dark, so wet, so
misty!</p>

<p>“When I try to see, there is a white wall of shadow,—I
think it is shadow; perhaps it is fog, but it is
always there,” said Gemma. “At home one looks, and
looks, and looks; there is no end to it.”</p>

<p>Gemma longed sorely to go home; she had not
minded the sea at all. Bindo, like Nonno, had been
very ill on the voyage and cried even now whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
he saw a ship, for fear he should be going in it. Bindo
was sadly babyish for ten years old; to make amends,
his sister was almost a woman at thirteen.</p>

<p>They ought now to have been all three serious and
alarmed, for Nonno’s satchel had not a penny in it,
nor a crust, and they were all hungry, for it was noonday.
But instead of being miserable they joked, and
laughed, and kissed each other, as thousands of their
country-folks at home with equally empty stomachs
were doing, lying on sunny moles, or marble-strewn
benches, or thymy turf under ilex shadows. But then
in our dear Italy there is always the sun, the light, the
air that kisses and feeds and sends to soft sleep her
children, and Gemma and her brother and grandfather
were in a wet English lane, with the clouds hurrying
up over the distant hills by Dartmoor, and the raindrops
still hanging to the great elm-boughs overhead.</p>

<p>Yet they were merry, and sang snatches of Neapolitan
songs, and took no thought for the morrow. They
were not far off Dartmouth, and they meant to go into
the quaint old town by market-day, and the Dart fisher-
and boating-folk were always kind to them. If they
were hungry now they would eat to-morrow.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, Nonno grew thoughtful as he
looked at Gemma, lying face downward on the wet
grass, her sandalled feet in air, a dragon-fly fluttering
above her head.</p>

<p>“What would you do if I were to die, my <i>piccicotta?</i>”
said the poor old man, all at once remembering
he was nigh eighty years old. Gemma raised herself,
and said nothing. Her eyes, which were very beautiful
eyes, grew sad and moist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“I would take care of Bindo, Nonno,” she answered,
at last. “Do not be afraid of that.”</p>

<p>“But how? It is easy to say. But how?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I could dance at theatres,” said Gemma
after reflection. Nonno shook his head.</p>

<p>“For the theatres you would need to dance differently:
it is all spinning, craning, drilling there; you
dance, my child, as a flower in the wind. The theatres
do not care for that.”</p>

<p>“Then I do not know,” said Gemma. “But something
I would do. Bindo should not suffer.”</p>

<p>“You are a good child,” said the old man, tenderly.
She sank down again on the grass.</p>

<p>“Do not think of dying, Nonno,” she said. “It is
all so dark where death is.”</p>

<p>“Not when one gets to the saints,” said the simple
old man. He always fancied Paradise just like Amalfi,—his
own Amalfi, where long ago, so long ago, he had
run and leaped, a merry naked boy, in the azure waves,
and caught the glittering sea-mouse and the pink column
of the gemmia in his hands. Paradise would be just
like Amalfi; the promise of it consoled him as he
trotted on tired limbs along the wet gravel of English
market-roads, or meekly bore the noisy horse-play of
English village crowds.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased, and the sun was shining a little
in a drowsy half-hearted way, as if it were but half
awake even at mid-day. There were big hedges on
either side of the lane, and broad strips of turf. These
lanes are almost all that is left of the rural and leafy
old England of Seventeen Hundred; and they are
beautiful in their own way when midsummer crowds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
them with flowers, and in spring when their palm-willows
blossom, and in autumn when their hazel-coppices
are brown with nuts, and in winter when their holly
and ivy clamber high, and their fine trees make a
tracery of bare boughs delicate as the net-work of lace
against the gray skies.</p>

<p>On the other side of the hedge, to their right, there
was a large corn-field; it was now the time when wheat
is ripe in England, and the men and women who were
reaping it were sitting, resting, drinking their cider and
eating their noonday bread and bacon. Bindo watched
them through a hole in the hedge, and began to cry.</p>

<p>“It makes me hungrier to see them eat!” he said,
with a sob. Gemma sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>“Do not cry so, my Bindo,” she said, with a tender
voice: “I will ask them to give you some.”</p>

<p>She thrust her lithe body through the gap, and
walked boldly across the field,—a strange figure for an
English corn-field, with her short white skirt, and her
red bodice, and her striped sash of many colors, and her
little coral ear-rings in her ears; she was bareheaded,
and her dusky gold hair, the hair that the old painters
loved, was coiled rope-like all around her small head.</p>

<p>“My little brother is hungry: will you be so very
gentle and give us a little bread?” she said, in her
pretty accent, which robbed the English tongue of all
its gutturals and clothed it in a sweetness not its own.
She was not fond of begging, being proud, and she
colored very much as she said it.</p>

<p>The reapers stared, then grinned, gaped once or twice,
and then stretched big brown hands out to her with
goodly portions of food, and one added a mug of cider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“I do thank you so much,” she said, with a smile
that was like a sunbeam. “The drink I take not, for
Nonno has no love of it; but for the bread I pray
may San Martino bless you!”</p>

<p>Then she courtesied to them, as nature and nobody
else had taught her to do, and ran away, fleet as a lapwing,
with her treasure.</p>

<p>“’Tis that dancing-girl of the Popish country,” said
the men one to another, and added that if the master
caught her in his lane ’twould be the worse for her, for
he couldna abide tramps and vagabon’s. But Gemma,
who knew nothing of that, was sharing her spoils with
glee, and breaking the small bit of bread she allowed
to herself with teeth as white as a dog’s.</p>

<p>“The way to Dartmouth will not now seem so long,”
she said, and Bindo nodded his head with a mouth quite
full of good brown bread and fat bacon.</p>

<p>“How much do they love <i>carne secca</i> here!” said
Nonno, with a sigh, thinking of the long coils of macaroni,
the lovely little fried fish, the oil, the garlic, the
black beans, that he never saw now, alas, alas! “The
land is fat, but the people they know not how to live,”
he added, with a sigh. “A people without wine,—what
should they know?”</p>

<p>“They make good bread,” said Gemma, with her
ivory teeth in a crust.</p>

<p>Meantime, the person who owned the lane was
coming out into the fields to see how his men got on
with their work. His house stood near, hidden in
trees on a bend of the Exe. He was rich, young,
prosperous, and handsome; he was also generous and
charitable; but he was a magistrate, and he hated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
strollers. By name he was known as Philip Carey;
his people had been squires here for many generations;
he called himself a yeoman, and was as proud as if he
were a prince.</p>

<p>As fates would have it, he rode down the lane now
on his gray horse, and when he saw the group of Nonno
and Gemma and Bindo, with their bags and bales and
bundles, scattered about on the turf of his lane, his
gray eyes grew ominously dark.</p>

<p>“Who gave you leave to come here?” he asked,
sternly enough, as he reined up his horse.</p>

<p>Nonno looked up smiling, and stood up and bowed
with grace and ease. The English tongue he had
never been able to master: he glanced at Gemma to
bid her answer.</p>

<p>“We were only resting, Excellenza,” said she, boldly.
“It is a public road.”</p>

<p>“It is not a public road,” said the owner of it.
“And if it were, you would have no right to cumber
it. Are you strollers?”</p>

<p>“Strollers?” repeated Gemma: she did not understand
the word.</p>

<p>“Tramps? Are you tramps?”</p>

<p>“We are artists,” said Gemma.</p>

<p>“What do you do for your living?” asked her judge.</p>

<p>“We dance,” she answered, “and Nonno yonder he
does conjuring tricks, and sometimes has a little lotto,
but that is only when we have got a little money: we
have none now.”</p>

<p>“A lottery!” exclaimed Mr. Carey, whose face grew
very stern. “You are mere idle vagabonds, then,
when you are not worse. Do you live by your wits?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“We dance,” said Gemma, again.</p>

<p>“Dance! Can you read and write?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no.”</p>

<p>“How old are you?”</p>

<p>“I am thirteen, Bindo is ten, Nonno is—is—is, oh,
as old as the world.”</p>

<p>“Is he your grandfather?”</p>

<p>“That is what you say in English. We say Nonno.”</p>

<p>“Cannot he speak English?”</p>

<p>“No: he has lost his teeth, and it is so hard, is your
English.”</p>

<p>“You are an impudent girl.”</p>

<p>Gemma smiled her beautiful shining smile, as if he
had paid her an admirable compliment.</p>

<p>She knew the rider by sight very well, though he
did not know her. His housekeeper had whipped
Bindo for getting into her poultry-house and putting
two eggs in his pocket, and his gardener one day had
turned them both out of his orchards as trespassers, so
that he and his residence of Carey’s Honor were already
scored with black in the tablets of the children’s
memories.</p>

<p>That he was a handsome young man, with a grave
and pensive face and a very sweet smile, when he did
smile, which was rarely, did not affect Gemma’s dislike
to him: she was too young to be impressed by good
looks. Philip Carey was not touched by the beauty
of her either: he scarcely saw that she was pretty, he
was so angry with her for what seemed to him her
saucy answers.</p>

<p>“Why are you not dressed like a Christian?” he
said, somewhat irrelevantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am a Christian,” said Gemma, angry in her turn,—“a
better Christian than you are. And what is my
dress to you? You do not buy it.”</p>

<p>“It is immodest.”</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!” cried Gemma, with a flame-like lightning
in her eyes; and like lightning she leaped up on
to the saddle and gave the astonished gentleman a
sounding box on both ears.</p>

<p>He was so utterly astonished that he had no time
to protect himself, and his horse, which was utterly
astonished too, began to plunge and rear and kick, and
fully occupied him, whilst a guffaw from the field beyond
added to his rage by telling him that his reapers
had witnessed his discomfiture.</p>

<p>Gemma had leaped to the ground as swiftly as she
had leaped to the saddle, and, whilst the horse was
rearing and plunging, had caught up their bag and
baggage, had pushed and pulled her brother and her
grandfather before her, and had flown down the lane
and out of sight before Philip Carey had reduced his
steed to any semblance of reason. His ears tingled and
his pride was bitterly incensed, yet he could not help
laughing at himself.</p>

<p>“The little tigress!” he thought, as he endeavored
to soothe his fretting and wheeling beast, which was
young and only half broken.</p>

<p>When he rode in at last by an open gate among his
reapers the men were all too afraid of him not to wear
very grave faces, as though they had seen nothing.
Every one was afraid of Philip Carey except his dogs,
which shows that he had a good heart under a stern
manner, for dogs never make mistakes as men do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>He remained about his fields all the day, and went
home to a solitary dinner. He had no living relative.
He was rather more of a scholar than a farmer, and
liked his loneliness. His old house, which was called
Carey’s Honor ever since the days of the Tudors, was
a rambling comfortable building, set amidst green lawn,
huge hew- and oak-trees, and meadows that stretched
downward to the broad Dart water. It was all within
and without as it had been in the days of the Armada,
and the ivy that covered it was as old as the brass
dogs in the big chimney-places. Many men with such
a possession would have been restless to reach a higher
rank, but Philip Carey was a grave young man, of refined
and severe taste and simple habits. He loved his
home, and was content with it, and wanted nothing of
the world.</p>

<p>This evening he did not feel so contented as usual:
his ears seemed still to tingle from those blows at the
hand of a child. He liked old Greek and Latin authors,
and when the day was done liked to sit and read
of a summer evening under the biggest yew upon his
lawn, with the lowing of the cattle, the song of the
nightingale, and the cries of the water-birds the only
sounds upon the quiet air. But this evening his favorite
philosophers said nothing to him: had Plato or
any one of them ever had his ears boxed by a little fury
of a strolling dancer?</p>

<p>The little fury, meanwhile, was dancing the <i>saltarello</i>
with her brother before a crazy old wooden inn in
Dartmouth,—dancing it as the girls do under the cork-trees
in Sardinia, and under the spreading oaks of the
Marches, and so pleasing the yokels of the river town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
with her grace and fire and animation that the pence
rolled in by scores into her tambourine, and the mistress
of the poor little inn said to her, “Nay, my pretty,
as you have gained them here you must spend them
here, and it is market-day to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Gemma was quite happy to have gained so much,
and she got a modest little supper for Nonno, and as
she shook down all her dark gold hair in the moonlight
and looked on the water rippling away past the
walls of the old castle she laughed out, though she was
all alone, thinking of the grave gentleman on the gray
horse, and murmured naughtily to herself, “I hope I
did hurt him! Oh, I hope I hurt him!”</p>

<p>Then she knew she ought not to hope that, and
kissed the Madonnina that hung at her throat, and asked
the Holy Mother’s pardon, and then laid herself down
on the little hard bed and went as sound asleep as a
flittermouse in winter-time.</p>

<p>The next day was market-day in the little sleepy
Old-World town upon the Dart, where the ships and
the boats go by on the gray sea and the brown river-water.
There would be watermen and countrymen,
both, in numbers, farmers and fisherfolk, millers and
cider-merchants, peddlers and hucksters, and egg-wives
and wagoners, and Nonno was early awakened by the
children, who were eager to begin getting more pence
with the sunrise: the pence when they <i>were</i> made had
such a terrible knack of flying away again. Gemma
believed that they grew wings like the butterflies,
though she never could see them, and though she and
Nonno kept such close watch and ward over them.</p>

<p>They made themselves as spruce as they could for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the day. Gemma had washed her white bodice and
Bindo’s white shirt, and, though the scarlet and the
blue and the yellow had got stained and weather-worn,
the clothes yet were picturesque, and with their curling
hair, and their beautiful big black eyes, and their cheeks
as warm and as soft as peaches, she and Bindo were a
pretty sight as they bent and swayed and circled and
moved, now so slowly, now so furiously, in the changes
of the <i>saltarello</i>, whilst their grandfather played for
them on a little wooden flute, and Gemma beat her
tambourine high above her auburn head, and, as the
music waxed faster and the dance wilder, sprang and
whirled and leaped and bounded for all the world, the
people said, like the jack-o’-lantern that flashes over
the bogs of Dartmoor.</p>

<p>They danced, with pauses for rest between their dances,
all the day long; and when they were so very tired that
they could dance no more, Nonno began his simple
tricks with his thimble and peas, his wooden cups, and
his little tray full of cards. They were innocent tricks,
and when he told fortunes by the cards (which Gemma
expounded to whosoever would pay a penny to hear the
future) he dealt out fate so handsomely that such a
destiny was very cheap indeed at four farthings.</p>

<p>The country-folks were pleased and content to have
a gilt coach and horses and all manner of good luck
promised them over the cards, and the youths liked to
look at pretty Gemma, who was so unlike the maidens
they picked apples with, or sold pilchards to, in their
green Devon; and so the day wore merrily on apace,
and the afternoon sun was slanting towards its setting
over the Cornish shores and Cornish seas far away to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the westward, when all in a moment there was a shout
of “Police! Police!” and the good-humored crowd
hustled together and made way, and two constables
with wooden truncheons, saying never a word, marched
up to the poor little tray-table, swept off it cards and
coins and conjuring toys, and arrested poor old trembling
Nonno in the sacred name of the Law!</p>

<p>Nonno began to scream a million words to a minute,
but, alas! they were all Italian words, nobody understood
one of them. Bindo sobbed, and Gemma, standing
a moment transfixed with horror, flew upon the
constable who had taken her poor old grandfather and
bit his arm till the blood spurted. Mad with pain, the
constable seized her, not gently, and clutched Bindo by
the collar with his other hand. There was no possibility
of resistance; Gemma fought, indeed, like a little
polecat, but the men were too strong for her; they soon
took her away through the crowd on the same road that
Nonno was taking peaceably, and when the crowd muttered
a little at its play being thus spoiled, the constables
only said, gruffly, “Get you out of the way, or
ye’ll be clapped in jail too, maybe; thimble-rigging,
card-sharping, posturing, gambling, swindling,—why,
this old dodger will have a month of treadmill if he
have a day!”</p>

<p>And the crowd said among itself that to be sure the
old fellow was a foreigner, it would not do to get into
trouble about him, and most likely he only made believe
to know the future; so left him to himself, and went
to the alehouses and consoled themselves for his misfortunes
in draughts of cider.</p>

<p>The two constables, meanwhile, consigned the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
man and his grandchildren to the lock-up: Nonno kept
sighing and sobbing, and asking innumerable questions
in his own tongue, and Bindo shrieked at the
top of his voice as he was dragged along; Gemma
alone, now that she was vanquished, was mute. Her
lips were shut and silent, but her eyes spoke, darting
out flames of fire as if Vesuvius itself were burning
behind them. For four whole years they had been
wandering about the southwest part of England, and
had done no less and no more than they had done
to-day, and never had they been told that it was
wrong.</p>

<p>How could it be wrong to make a pea jump away
from under a wooden cup, and promise a ploughman
or a wagoner a coach and horses if it pleased him?
For if Nonno did cheat a little, ever so little, poor old
man, the children did not know it, and whatever
Nonno did was always to them alike virtue and wisdom.</p>

<p>The constables were very angry with them; Gemma
had bitten one of them as if she were a little wild-cat,
and the old man seemed to them a sorry old rascal,
living by his wits and his tricks and promising the
yokels coaches-and-six to turn a penny. Foreigners
are not favored by the rural police in England; and
whether they have plaster casts, dancing bears, singing
children, performing mice or monkeys, or only a few
conjuring toys, like poor old Epifania Santo, it is all
one to the rural police: down they go as members
of the dangerous classes. If the market-folks wanted
diversion, there were good, honest Punch and Judy
generally to be seen on fair-days; and once or twice a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
year, at the great cider or horse fairs, there came always
a show, with dwarfs, and giants, and a calf with two
heads: what more could any country population need
in the way of entertainment?</p>

<p>Into the lock-up, accordingly, they put poor Nonno
and his grandchildren, and shut and locked the door
upon them.</p>

<p>It was now evening-time: there was clean straw in
the place, and a mug of water and some bread. Nonno
and Bindo abandoned themselves to the uttermost hopelessness
of despair, and laid themselves face downward
on the straw, sobbing their very hearts out. Gemma
was dry-eyed, her forehead was crimson, her teeth were
set; she was consumed with rage, that burnt up alike
her terror and her pain. Oh, why did not a handful
of Neapolitan sailors sail over the water, and land, and
kill all these English? It was four years since she
had seen Naples, but she remembered,—oh, how she
remembered! And they had come all the way out of
their own sunshine only to be locked up in a trap like
rats! Furious thoughts of setting fire to this prison-house
beset her; she had matches in her pocket, but it
would be hard to set it on fire without consuming themselves
with it, since the doors were fast locked. What
could she do? what could she do?</p>

<p>“Why do they take us? We have done no harm,”
she said, through her shut teeth.</p>

<p>“<i>Carina mia</i>,” sighed her grandfather, shivering
where he lay on the straw, “I am afraid before the
law we are no better than the owls and the wood-rats
are; we are only vagabonds; we have no dwelling and
we have no trade.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“We pay for our lodging, and we pay for our
bread!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they do not believe that. Always have I
been so afraid this would happen, and now it has come
at last.”</p>

<p>The poor old man sank back on the straw again,
and began to sob piteously. Why had he left the merry
crowds of the Strada del Male, where there was always
a laugh and a song, and a slice of melon or of <i>pasta?</i></p>

<p>At last both he and Bindo sobbed themselves into
sleep, but no sleep came to Gemma; she was wide
awake, panting, hot, all alive with fury, all the night.</p>

<p>With morning they were all taken before the magistrates,
who were sitting that day. There were a great
many gentlemen and officials, but among them all
Gemma only saw one, the horseman whose ears she
had boxed in the lane. For Philip Carey was on the
bench that day, and recognized, with not much pleasure,
the little group of Italian strollers. They all three
looked miserable, jaded, and very dusty. The night
passed in the lock-up had taken all their look of sunshiny
merriment away; the straw had caught on their
poor garments; the faces of Nonno and the little boy
were swollen and disfigured with crying; only Gemma,
all dishevelled and dusty and feverish, had a pride and
ferocity about her that gave her strength and kept her
beauty.</p>

<p>As she was the only one who could talk any English,
she was ordered to speak for the others; but when she
said her grandfather’s name was Epifania Santo, there
was a laughter in the court, which incensed her so
bitterly that she flung back her curls out of her eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and said, “If you do not believe what I say, why do
you want me to speak?”</p>

<p>Then being once started she went on before any of
the magistrates or officials could stop her: “You have
taken us up; why have you taken us up? we have
done nobody any sort of harm. We only dance, and
Nonno tells fortunes, and does the tricks, and you have
taken his box away, and do you call that honest to a
poor man? We do not rob, we do not kill, we do not
hurt; when Bindo takes an apple I am angry.” And
then her English, which was apt to go away from her
in moments of excitement, failed her utterly, and she
poured out a torrent of Neapolitan patois which not a
soul there present understood, only from her flashing
eyes and her expressive gestures it was easy to guess
that it meant vehement invective and reproach.</p>

<p>Mr. Carey looked at her attentively, but he said
nothing; his brother magistrates, when she had been
peremptorily ordered to be still and listen, put a few
sharp questions to her and examined the witnesses,
who were policemen and country-people, and who all
deposed to the fact that the old Italian did tricks and
told fortunes and got them to put their pence down by
fair promises, and had moreover dice and cards whereby
he induced them to lose money. The children only
danced; they had no habitation; they were always
wandering about; by their papers they were natives of
Naples. Then the constable whose arm Gemma had
bitten appeared with it in a sling, and stated what she
had done to him, and this terrible piece of violence
prejudiced the whole court greatly against her.</p>

<p>Mr. Carey smiled once; he took no share in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
examination. But Gemma was always looking at him;
she was always thinking, “This is all his doing because
I struck him: he has had us all put in prison because
I offended him.”</p>

<p>She hated him,—oh, how she hated him! If she
had not been so watched and warded by the constables,
she would have leaped across the court and done the
same thing again. For she did not mind anything for
herself; but if they put Nonno and Bindo back in
prison, and parted them from her,—she knew people
were parted in prison and boys and girls were never
together there, nor ever the old left with the young.
And she knew too that in England there were prisons
called workhouses, where they packed away all the
people who were poor. Her heart stood still with
fright, and all she saw in the dusky court was the
grave face of Philip Carey, which seemed to her like
the stony face of Fate.</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>bimba mia</i>,” sobbed her grandfather in a
whisper, “yonder is the gentleman you struck as he
rode on his horse. You have been our undoing with
your fiery temper: always was I afraid that you
would be!”</p>

<p>Under that reproof Gemma’s head drooped and all
the color fled out of her cheeks. She knew that it was
a just one.</p>

<p>Bindo, meanwhile, was clinging to her skirts and
whimpering like a poor little beaten puppy, till she
thought her very brain would go mad, whirling round
and round in such misery.</p>

<p>The magistrates spoke together, Mr. Carey alone
saying little: there was a strong feeling against all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
strollers at that time in the county, on account of
many robberies that had been committed on outlying
farms by tramps and gypsies in the last few years, and
many raids that had been made on poultry-houses,
apple-lofts, and sheep-folds. Epifania Santo and his
grandchildren only seemed to the bench idle, useless,
and not harmless vagrants, no better than the wood-rats,
as old Nonno had said; whilst the fierce onslaught
on the constable of which Gemma had been guilty gave
their misdeeds a darker color in the eyes of the Devon
gentlemen.</p>

<p>After some consultation and some disagreement
among the magistrates, the old man, having no visible
means of subsistence, was condemned to a month’s
imprisonment for unlawfully gambling and deceiving
the public, whilst Bindo and Gemma were respectively
ordered to be consigned to reformatories. In consideration
of Epifania Santo’s age, and of his being a
foreigner, he was spared hard labor. When Gemma
comprehended the sentence, and the old man had been
made to understand it also, such a scene of grief and
of despair ensued as no English court had ever beheld.
To the slow and stolid folk of the banks of Dart it
seemed as if madness had descended straight upon
these strangers. Their passionate paroxysms of woe
had no limit, and no likeness to anything ever seen in
Devon before.</p>

<p>Gemma had to be torn by main force from her
brother and grandfather, and, writhing in the hands
of the constables as an otter writhes on a spear, she
shook her little clinched fists at the bench, and, seeing
there only the face of Philip Carey, who to her belief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
was sole author of all her sorrows and ills, she cried
to him, “I struck you yesterday, I will hurt you more
before many days are over. You are a wicked, wicked,
wicked man!”</p>

<p>Then the policeman seized her more roughly, and
put his hand over her mouth, and carried her away by
sheer force.</p>

<p>“Did that little jade really strike you a blow,
Carey?” asked one of his fellow-magistrates, in surprise.</p>

<p>Mr. Carey smiled a little. “Oh, yes,” he said, quietly.
“But I had deserved it.”</p>

<p>“I wonder you wanted us to be more lenient, then.”</p>

<p>“One cannot be revenged on a child,” he answered,
“and they are children of the sun; they have hotter
passions than ours, and quicker oblivion. It would
have been better to have given them a little money and
shipped them back to Naples. But you outnumbered
me. The old man is inoffensive, I think. After all,
a penny was not much for a yokel to pay to be blessed
by the promise of a coach-and-six.”</p>

<p>But his fellow-magistrates did not see the matter
in this light, and thought the old stroller well out
of mischief in the jail of Dartmouth. Philip Carey
two days before would have thought so with them,
for he had the reputation of being severe on the
bench; but the sunny, dusky, ardent face of Gemma
had touched him, and the love of the three for each
other seemed enviable to him. He had been all alone
since his early boyhood, and such affection as theirs
seemed to him a beautiful and priceless treasure.
It was cruel, he thought, to tear it asunder, as cruel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
as to pluck all to pieces a red rose just flowered to
the light.</p>

<p>He rode home that evening in the twilight, somewhat
saddened, and doubtful whether the law was as
just and unerring a thing as he had always until then
believed it.</p>

<p>The night saw poor old Nonno put in prison as if
he were a thief, and saw the children severed and
taken respectively to the boys’ and the girls’ asylum
in a reformatory for naughty children, which some
good people with the best intentions had built and
endowed in the neighborhood. They had so clung
together, and so madly resisted being parted, that they
had fairly frightened the men and women in charge
of them. They had never been away from each other
an hour in their lives ever since little Bindo had been
born one summer day in the cabin by the Mediterranean
and laid in the half of a great gourd as a cradle
for his sister’s wondering eyes to admire. But severed
now they were, and whilst poor Bindo in the boys’
ward was subjected to such a scrubbing as he had
never had in all his days, and his abundant auburn
curls were cut short, Gemma—whose paroxysms of
passion had given place to a stolid and strange quietude—was
also bathed, and clothed in the clothes of
the reformatory, whilst her many-colored sash, her picturesque
petticoats, and her coral ear-rings and necklace
were all taken away, fumigated, rolled up in a bundle,
and ticketed with a number. She submitted, but her
great eyes glared and glowed strangely, and she was
perfectly mute. Not a single sound could those set in
command over her force from her lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The superiors were used to stubborn children, savage
children, timid children, vicious children; but this
silence of hers, following on her delirium of fury and
grief, was new and startling to them.</p>

<p>She looked very odd, clad perforce in some straightly-cut
stiff gray clothes, and when she was set down, one
of a long row, to have supper off oatmeal porridge, the
handsome, pale, desperate little face of hers, with burning
eyes and an arched red mouth, looked amidst the
faces of the other little girls like a carnation among
cabbage-stalks. Not a morsel would she eat; not a
word would she speak; at no one would she even
look.</p>

<p>“Oh, Nonno! oh, Bindo!” her heart kept crying,
till it seemed as if it would burst, but never a sound
escaped her.</p>

<p>Poor little Bindo, meanwhile, was sobbing every
minute, but he ate his porridge, though he watered
it with floods of tears, where he was set among a score
of gray-clad, crop-headed English boys, who were
gaping and grinning at him.</p>

<p>With the close of evening Bindo was stowed away
in the boys’ dormitory, and Gemma was led to one of
a number of narrow little iron beds with blue counterpanes.
She was undressed and bidden to lie down,
which she did. Her bed was the last of the row, and
next to the wall: she turned her face to the wall and
they thought her resigned. Soon the light was put
out, and the little sleepers were in the land of dreams.</p>

<p>But Gemma never closed her eyes. Her heart
seemed to be beating all over her body. She stuffed
the sheet into her mouth, and bit it hard to keep in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
cries of agony that sprang to her lips. Would she
ever see Nonno again? Bindo she might, perhaps,
but Nonno,—she was sure he would die in prison.</p>

<p>There was a window in the wall near the bed; it was
unshuttered. She could see the gray of the evening
change to the dark of the night, and then the moon
came out,—the harvest-moon, as they called it here.
She was only waiting for every one to be asleep to get
up and look out of that window and see whether it
would let her escape. An under-matron slept in the
dormitory, but at the farther end, where everything
was quite hushed, and when the slow breathing of
the children told that they were all sleeping soundly,
Gemma got up in her bed and sat erect. Finding all
was still, she put one foot out of bed, and then another,
and very softly stole to the window. It was a
lattice window, and left a little open, for the night was
warm. A sweet smell of moist fields, of growing
grass, of honeysuckle hedges, came up on the night
air. Gemma noiselessly opened the window a little
farther and looked out: it was far, far down to the
ground below: still, she thought it was possible for her
to escape. She stole back to the bedside, put on the
hideous, ungainly cotton clothes as well as she could
in the dark, and knotted the skirt of the frock tight
round her limbs so as to leave them untrammelled.
If no one awoke, she could get away, she reflected;
for her quick eyes had seen a rain-pipe that passed
from the casement to the ground.</p>

<p>She paused a few moments, making sure, quite sure,
that every one in the long dormitory was asleep. As
she stood she saw some hundred matches lying by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
lamp, of which the light was put out, on a little table
near. A cruel joy danced into her eyes: she stretched
out her hand and took the matches and slipped them
in the bosom of her frock. Then, with the courage
of desperation, she climbed to the window-seat, put
half her body out of it, and, clinging to the iron
pipe with both hands, let herself slide down, down,
down, to where she knew not. All was dark beneath
her.</p>

<p>But if she slid into the sea that would be better, she
said to herself, than to live on imprisoned.</p>

<p>As it happened, the window was twenty feet and
more from the earth, but the turf was beneath, and
the rain-pipe was so made that she could easily clasp
it with feet and hands and glide down it, only grazing
all the skin off her palms, and bruising her knees and
her chest. No one heard her, there was no alarm
given; she reached the ground in safety as a village
clock tolled ten.</p>

<p>She dropped all in a heap, and lay still, half stunned,
for some moments; soon she got her breath and her
wits again, and rose up on her feet and looked about
her. She knew all the country-side well, having been
here ever since the apple-orchards had been in blossom,
and, when they had not been performing, having scampered
hither and thither with Bindo, begging honey or
eggs at the cottages, or coaxing the boatmen to let them
drift down the river.</p>

<p>The moon was now very bright, and she saw that
she stood near the Dart water, and she could discover
here a steeple, there a gable, yonder a windmill, and so
forth, by which she could tell where she was. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
been brought in a covered van to the reformatory, and
had only known that it was near Dartmouth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 428px;">
<img src="images/i-173.jpg" width="428" height="600" alt="girl running through woods" />
<div class="caption">SHE ONLY RAN ON, STUMBLING OFTEN, AND FEELING FOR THE MATCHES IN THE BOSOM
OF HER UGLY GRAY COTTON FROCK</div>
</div>

<p>The grass on which she stood grew under a low wall,
and beyond the wall was a towing-path, and beyond
that the river. The towing-path she knew well; she
and Bindo had often ridden on the backs of the towing-horses
or got a seat in the big barges by just singing
their little songs and twanging their tambourines.</p>

<p>The towing-path served her purpose well. She
looked back at the big pile behind her, a white, square,
grim-looking place; Bindo was sleeping under its roof;
then she hardened her heart, vaulted over the river-wall,
and began to run down the river-path.</p>

<p>She did not hesitate, for she had a very wicked resolve
in her soul, and her goal was four miles away,
she knew, as a water-mill on the other bank among
willows was an old friend of hers, and told her her
whereabouts. Not a sound came from the house behind
her; not a creature had awakened, or the alarm-bell
would have been clanging and lights appearing at
every window. She was quite safe thus far, and she
began to run along the dewy grassy path where the
glowworms were twinkling at every step under the
ferns and the dock leaves.</p>

<p>“The wicked, wicked man!” she kept saying in her
teeth.</p>

<p>She never saw the pretty glowworms she was so
fond of at other times, or heard the nightingales singing
in the woods, for when a sin is in the soul it makes
the eyes blind and the ears deaf. She only ran on,
stumbling often and feeling for the matches in the
bosom of her ugly gray cotton frock. The frock was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
irksome to her: she longed for her own short skirts
and pliable bodice, and she missed the scarf about her
loins, and the necklace at her throat. But she ran on
and on, having a set purpose and a great crime in her
mind.</p>

<p>She knew that if she only followed the towing-path
long enough she would come to the place called Carey’s
Honor.</p>

<p>She knew it well: she had often looked over its
white gates and envied the calves and the lambs in
its pastures, and wondered what the rooms were like
within beyond the rose-hung windows, and sighed for
the nectarines and the cherries that grew in its green
old garden-ways. It might be farther or nearer than
she fancied; that she could not be sure about; but she
knew that if she went on long enough along the Dart
water she would come to it. She did not feel at all
frightened at being out all alone so late; after the excitement
and despair of the day she seemed to have no
feeling left except this one burning, consuming, terrible
longing for vengeance, which made her feet fly over
the towing-path to the peaceful Elizabethan house
lying among its yews and limes and stacks and hives
and byres in the moonlight.</p>

<p>She had been running and walking an hour and a
half or more, when a bend in the water showed her
the twisted chimney-stacks and the black-and-white
wood-work and the honeysuckle-covered porches of
the homestead, with the moon shining above it and
the green uplands sloping behind. Then Gemma,
whose young soul was now so full of wickedness that
there was not a spot of light left in it, climbed over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the white wooden gate and crept up over the wide
grass-lands where the cattle were asleep and the big
ox-eye daisies were shut up at rest. The air was full
of the sweet smell of the dog-rose, of the honeysuckle,
of the sweet brier, and away across the meadows the
black-and-white timbers and the deep gables of the
old house were distinct in the moon-rays.</p>

<p>She crossed the pastures and opened a little wicket
that was never latched, and got into the gardens, where
the stocks and picotees and gilly-flowers and moss roses
and sweet williams and all other dear old-fashioned
blossoms were filling the night with their fragrance.
But Gemma had no thought for them. She crept on
up to the house, and saw that in one part the thatched
roof came down so low to the ground that, standing
on a stone bench which was beneath, she would be able
to touch it. She sprang on to the bench, drew her
matches out of her bosom, struck light to them, and
was about to thrust the blazing bunch into the thatch,
when a huge dog bounded out of the shadow, leaped
on her, and knocked her head downwards off the stone
seat on to the grass: he would have torn her to pieces,
only he was such a great and good creature that, seeing
she was a child, he was merciful in his strength.</p>

<p>“Monarch, what is it, my lad?” said Philip Carey,
as he came out from the open door of the porch,
alarmed at the noise of the fall.</p>

<p>The Newfoundland left her and went to his master,
and Mr. Carey saw the form of Gemma lying prone
upon his gravel and the bundle of blazing matches
still clutched in her clinched hand.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! the child came to burn my house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
down!” he cried, half aloud, as he stooped over her and
lifted her up: she had fallen on the back of her head
and was stunned into insensibility for the moment.
He wrenched the burning matches out of her tightly-closed
fingers and stamped the fire out of them with
his heel. That was soon done, and when the dangerous
things were mere harmless splinters of wood he
lifted the insensible form of the child up in his arms
and carried her into his house.</p>

<p>“She has escaped from the reformatory,” he thought,
as he saw the ugly gray cotton gown and the blue apron
that was tacked on to it.</p>

<p>He laid her gently on a couch, and called his housekeeper,
a white-haired, kindly old woman, with cheeks
like the apples that crowded his orchards in October.</p>

<p>“Monarch knocked this little girl down, and she is
senseless with the fall. Will you do your best for her,
Mary? She is one of the Home children,” he said to
the old dame, and he did not add a word about the
matches.</p>

<p>The housekeeper’s simple remedies soon recalled
Gemma back to her senses, and she opened her great,
frightened, humid eyes to the light of the lamp-lit
room.</p>

<p>“<i>I zolfini, I zolfini!</i>” she murmured, thinking of her
matches and vaguely fancying that she was in the midst
of flames. All her English had gone clean away from
her.</p>

<p>“It is that foreign child, master,” said the housekeeper,—“the
one that has been roaming the country
ever since Candlemas; I caught her little brother at
the hen house at Easter-time, and spanked him. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
were both of them sentenced, weren’t they, in town
this morning, and the old grandfather too?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Carey, curtly, “she has run away,
that is evident. Suppose you go and get some little
room ready for her, for she will not be able to go back
to-night. She is all right now, I fancy, though she is
not yet fairly awake.”</p>

<p>“One of the attics, master? Shall she sleep with
Hannah?—not as Hannah will stomach it, a little
waif and stray out of prison——”</p>

<p>“No, no; get her a nice little room ready anywhere
you like, but one that is comfortable. She is a very
forlorn little maid: we must be good to her, Mary.”</p>

<p>“Her little brother was at the hen-house, and I
spanked him——”</p>

<p>“She is not her brother,” said Philip Carey, impatiently.
“Leave me with her a little.”</p>

<p>Though her master was very gentle, the housekeeper
knew that he chose to be obeyed, and she
trotted off up the broad oak staircase obediently.</p>

<p>Philip Carey remained beside Gemma; and the big
black dog also sat looking at her, with his head held
critically on one side, for he had not made up his mind
about her.</p>

<p>“You came to burn my house down?” said Mr.
Carey, gravely, as he looked full into her face.</p>

<p>She understood what he said, but she did not answer.
Her mind was still confused; she remembered what
she had come to do, and she began to understand that
she had failed to do it and was in the power of this man
whom she hated.</p>

<p>“I caught you in the act,” he continued, sternly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
“and if my dog had not thrown you down you would
probably have succeeded, for old thatch burns like tinder.
Now, will you tell me why you wished to do me
so great an injury?”</p>

<p>Gemma was still mute; her brows were drawn together,
her eyes underneath them were flashing and
sombre; she had raised herself on one arm on the
cushions of the couch, and gazed at him in silence.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you do not know,” said Mr. Carey, “that
the crime of arson, the crime you tried to commit, is
one punished by only less severity than is shown to
murder. Very often it becomes murder too, when
people are burned, as they often are, in the house
that is fired. For the mere attempt I can have you
imprisoned for many years. Now tell me, I order
you to tell me instantly, why you desired to injure me
so hideously?”</p>

<p>Gemma followed his words and gathered their meaning,
and felt forced to obey. But all the passion of
hate and of pain in her surged up in broken utterances,
for the foreign language was ill able to convey all the
vehemence of emotion and of indignation raging in her
heart.</p>

<p>“I came—I came—I came,” she muttered, “I came
to burn your house: yes; why not? I told you in the
morning I would do something worse to you. I did
strike you, but you had deserved it. You had said I
was immodest; and then because you were angry you
had us all taken up by the police, and you put dear
Nonno in prison as if he were a thief, when he is so
honest that he scolds Bindo if Bindo takes an apple,
and you have parted me and Bindo, and shut us in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
horrible place, and they have cut our hair and washed
us, and I saw I could get away to-night, and I did,
and I dropped through the window; and the matches
were there, and I said to myself I would burn your
house down; I had heard people say that you were
fond of your house, and if you say that it was wicked
of me, it has been you who have been wicked first.
You are a bad, vile, cruel man to shut dear Nonno
into your prisons, and he nearly <i>ottant’ uno</i> years old,
and so good and so kind and so merry; and never will
we see him again, and sooner than go back to that place
which you put me in, I will drown myself in your river
there, or make your dog tear me to pieces——”</p>

<p>Then the poor little soul burst into a rain of tears
enough to have extinguished a million lighted lucifer
matches or the very fires of a burning house had there
been one.</p>

<p>Philip Carey allowed the tempest of grief to exhaust
itself; then he said to her, in a grave and very sweet
voice, yet a little sternly,—</p>

<p>“My poor little girl, you were ready to take a great
crime on your little white soul to-night; and who
knows where its evil might have stopped? Fire is not
a plaything. Now, I want you to listen to what I have
to say about myself. I am a magistrate, and I was on
the bench to-day, it is true. But I did not approve of
the sentence passed on you by men of greater age and
weight in the county than I am, and I tried my best,
vainly, to have it mitigated. I had nothing whatever
to do with your grandfather’s arrest. What he did,
harmless though it seems, was yet against the law; and
the mayor of the town chose to enforce the law against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
him. More than this, my dear, not only would I not,
had I been alone, have sentenced your grandfather in
so severe a manner, but I would have aided you all to
return to your own country. As it is, I mean to-morrow
to use what influence I possess to endeavor to obtain
a remission of your grandfather’s sentence, and I
meant also to go across to Portsmouth and see the
Italian consul there, to ascertain whether or not he
could not help you to go back to Naples if I could
succeed in getting your punishments remitted, as I
hoped to do.”</p>

<p>He paused, and Gemma gazed at him with dilated
eyes and a hot color on her cheeks. She was silent
and ashamed.</p>

<p>“Now you have spoiled it all,” continued Mr. Carey:
“how can I beg for a little incendiary to be let loose
on the world? And my gardener will see those lucifer
matches in the morning, and every one will know or
guess then what you came to do, and why my dog
Monarch sprang on you.”</p>

<p>The color went out of her face, and her lips quivered.</p>

<p>“But it was only <i>me</i>,” she said, piteously. “Nonno
would not have tried to fire your house, nor Bindo.
It was only me. Could you not punish me all by myself
and let them out? If you will only let them out,
I will go back to prison, and I will not run away again:
I will bear it all my life if I must, if you will only
let out Nonno and Bindo!”</p>

<p>“My dear,” answered Philip Carey, “I have no
power: I cannot deal you out life and death, as you
seem to think. You are a dangerous and fierce little
tigress, of that there is no doubt; but I do not think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the reformatory, good as it is, would improve you much.
Suppose we make a bargain: if you will promise me
to try and be good, I will promise you to try and liberate
you all three, and send you all back in a good ship
to your own country.”</p>

<p>With as much rapidity as she had sprung up on his
saddle to box his ears, Gemma sprang off the couch,
and, to his great amazement, threw her arms about his
neck and kissed him.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are good!” she murmured, rapturously.
“I love you, I love you, I love you as much as I
hated you yesterday!”</p>

<p>And she was so pretty that Philip Carey could not
be angry with her any more.</p>

<p>She slept soundly that night under the roof she had
tried to burn, and in the morning had the most tempting
breakfast brought to her on her little bed that she
had ever imagined in all her life, and Monarch came
and put his big muzzle down on the snowy counterpane,
and made friends with her over honey and muffins and
cream.</p>

<p>Mr. Carey kept his promise, and, by means of continuous
efforts for some ten days, succeeded in getting
the release of poor old Epifania Santo and of Bindo,
and obtaining also for them a free passage by a sailing-ship
then loading in Devonport and bound to go down
Channel to the south coast of Italy with a cargo of iron
and steel.</p>

<p>During this time that he was thus returning good for
evil and exerting himself in her cause, Gemma remained
under the care of his housekeeper, and saw him very
often in each day, and had a simple, pretty, white linen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
frock made for her, and spent all her time in the gardens
and orchards and meadows with Monarch and the
other dogs of the house.</p>

<p>When Philip Carey at last announced to her that all
was arranged for their departure by the sailing-vessel,
and that she would meet her brother and grandfather
at the docks, he was surprised to see a cloud sweep
over her mobile face, and great tears fill her eyes once
more.</p>

<p>“Cannot we stay? cannot we stay?” she said, with a
sob. “Grandfather is so afraid of the sea, and Bindo
will be so sorry to leave before the apples are ripe, and
me,—I cannot bear to leave <i>you!</i>”</p>

<p>“Do you like me a little, then?” said Mr. Carey,
astonished and touched.</p>

<p>“Oh, so much!” said Gemma, with a great sigh.
“You have been so kind, and I have been so wicked.”</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment, much surprised, then answered,—</p>

<p>“Well, it might perhaps be arranged. Your grandfather
is very old for a voyage, and there is a little
cottage down beyond my orchards that he might have;
but, Gemma, if I let you stay on my land, you must
promise me to be very reasonable and obedient, and to
learn all you are told to learn, and never to give way
to your furious passions.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will be so good!” she cried, in ecstasy, as she
sprang up in his arms and kissed him again. “I will
be so good! and when I am with you I forget that we
never really see the sun, and Bindo says he is sure that
your apples are better than our grapes and figs and
oranges at home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is well you should think so, if you are to live
all your lives amidst the apples,” said Philip Carey,
with a smile.</p>

<p>So they stayed there; and a few years later, when
Gemma had grown a most beautiful young girl, and
become wise and gentle as well, though she still kept
her April face that was all sunshine and storm in the
same moment, Philip Carey made her his wife and
Monarch’s mistress; and she is still always ready to
declare that apples are the best and sweetest fruit that
grows. For, you see, Love gathers them for her.</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE EARL</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> little Earl was a very little one indeed, as
far as years and stature were, but he was a very big
one if you consider his possessions and his importance.
He was only a month old when his father
died, and only six months old when his mother, too,
left him for the cold damp vault, with its marbles
and its rows of velvet coffins,—a vault that was very
grand, but so chilly and so desolate that when they
took the little Earl there on holy-days to lay his
flowers down upon the dead he could never sleep for
nights afterwards, remembering its darkness and
solemnity.</p>

<p>The little Earl was called Hubert Hugh Lupus
Alured Beaudesert, and was the Earl of Avillion and
Lantrissaint; but by his own friends and his grandmother
and his old nurse he was called only Bertie.</p>

<p>He was eight years old in the summer-time, when
there befell him the adventure I am going now to relate
to you, and he was, for his age, quite a baby; he was
slender and slight, and he had a sweet little face like a
flower, with very big eyes, and a quantity of fair hair
cut after the fashion of the Reynolds and Gainsborough
children. He had always been kept as if he
were a china doll that would break at a touch. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
grandmother and his uncle had been left the sole charge
of him; and as they were both invalids, and the latter
a priest, and both dwelt in great retirement at the castle
of Avillion, the little Earl’s little life had not been a
boy’s life.</p>

<p>He had always been tranquil, for every one loved
him, and he had all things that he wished for; yet he
was treated more as if he were a rare flower or a most
fragile piece of porcelain, than a little bright boy of
real flesh and blood; and, without knowing it, he was
often tired of all his cotton-wool. He was such a tiny
fellow, you see, to be the head of his race, and the last
of it too; for there were no others of this great race
from which he had sprung, and his uncle, as a priest,
could never marry. Thus so much depended on this
small short life that the fuss made over him, and the
care taken of him, had ended in making him so incapable
of taking any care of himself that if he had
ever got out alone in a street he would have been run
over to a certainty, and as he grew older he grew sad
and feverish, and chafed because he was never allowed
to do the things that all boys by instinct love to do.
By nature the little Earl was very brave, but he was
made timid by incessant cautions; and as he was, too,
by nature very thoughtful, the seclusion from other
children in which he was brought up made him too
serious for his age.</p>

<p>Avillion was deep-bosomed in woods, throned high
above a lake and moors and mountains, and setting its
vast stone buttresses firmly down into the greenest,
smoothest turf in all the green west country of England
a grand and glorious place, famous in history,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
full of majesty and magnificence, and sung to, forever,
by the deep music of the Atlantic waves. Once upon
a time the Arthurian Court that Mr. Tennyson has told
you of so often had held its solemn jousts and its blameless
revels there; at least, so said the story of Avillion,
as told in ballads of the country-side,—more trustworthy
historians than most people think.</p>

<p>All those ballads the little Earl knew by heart, and
he loved them more than anything, for Deborah, his
nurse, had crooned them over his cradle before ever he
could understand even the words of them; so that
Arthur and Launcelot, and Sir Gawain and Sir Galahad,
and all the knightly lives that were once at Tintagel,
were more real to him than the living figures
about him, and these fancies served him as his playmates,—for
he had few others, except his dog Ralph and
his pony Royal. His relatives were ailing, melancholy,
attached to silence and solitude, and though they would
have melted gold and pearls for Bertie’s drinking if
he could have drunk them, never bethought themselves
that noise and romps and laughter and fun and a little
spice of peril are all things without which a child’s life
is as dead and spiritless as a squirrel’s in a cage. And
Bertie did not know it either. He studied under his
tutor, Father Philip, a noble and learned old man, and
he was caressed and cosseted by his nurse Deborah, and
he wore beautiful little dresses, most usually of velvet,
and he had wonderful toys that were sent from Paris,
automatons that danced and fenced and played the
guitar and animals that did just what live animals do
and Punches and puppets that played and mimicked by
clock-work, and little yachts that sailed by clock-work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and whole armies of soldiers, and marvellous games
costly and splendid; but he had nobody to play at all
these things with, and it was dull work playing with
them by himself. Deborah played with them in the
best way she knew, but she was not a child, being sixty-six
years old, and was of a slow imagination and of
rheumatic movements.</p>

<p>“Run and play,” Father Philip would often say to
him, taking him perforce from his books; but the
little Earl would answer, sadly, “I have nobody to
play with!”</p>

<p>That want of his attracted no attention from all
those people who loved the ground his little feet trod
on; he was surrounded with every splendor and indulgence,
he had half the toys of the Palais Royal in his
nursery, and he had a bed to sleep in of ivory inlaid
with silver, that had once belonged to the little King
of Rome; millions of money were being stored up for
him, and lands wide enough to make a principality
called him lord: it never occurred to anybody that the
little Earl of Avillion was not the most fortunate child
that lived under the sun.</p>

<p>“Why do people all call me ‘my lord’?” he asked
one day, suddenly becoming observant of this fact.</p>

<p>“Because you are my lord,” said Deborah,—which
did not content him.</p>

<p>He asked Father Philip.</p>

<p>“My dear little boy, it is your title: think not of
it save as an obligation to bear your rank well and
without stain.”</p>

<p>At last the little Earl grew so pale and thin and so
delicate in health that the physician who was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
watching over him said to his grandmother that the boy
wanted change of air, and advised the southern coast
for him, and cessation of almost all study; which order
grieved Father Philip sorely, for Bertie could read his
Livy well, and was beginning to spell through his
Xenophon, and it cut the learned gentleman to the
heart that his pupil should give up all this and go back
on the royal road to learning. For both he and his
uncle were resolved that the little Earl should be very
learned, and the boy was eager enough to learn, only
he liked still better knowing how the flowers grew, and
why the birds could fly while he could not, and how
the wood-bee made his neat house in the tree-trunk, and
the beaver built his dam across the river,—inquiries
which everybody about him was inclined to discourage.
Natural science was not looked on with favor in the
nursery and school-room of Avillion. It was considered
to lead people astray.</p>

<p>So the little Earl was moved southward, with his
grandmother, and his nurse, and his physician, and
Ralph and Royal,—for he would not go without them,—and
several servants as well. They were to go to
Shanklin in the Isle of Wight, and they made the
journey by sea in the beautiful sailing-yacht which was
waiting for Bertie’s manhood, after having been the
idol of his father’s. On board, the little Earl was well
amused; but he worried every one about him by questions
as to the fishes.</p>

<p>“Lord, child! they are but nasty clammy things,
only nice when they are cooked,” said his nurse; and
his grandmamma said to him, “Dear, they were made
to live in the sea, just as the birds are made to fly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the air.” And this did not satisfy the little man at all;
but he could get no more information, for the doctor,
who could have told him a good deal, was under the
thumb of his stately mistress, and Lady Avillion had
said very sternly that the boy was not to be encouraged
in his nonsense: what he must be taught were the
duties of his position and all he owed to the country,—the
poor little Earl!</p>

<p>He was a very small, slender, pale-cheeked lord indeed,
with his golden hair hanging over his puzzled
forehead, that used to ache sometimes with carrying
Xenophon and Livy, and underneath the hair two
great wondering blue eyes, of a blue so dark that they
were like wet violets. His hands were tiny and thin,
and his legs, clad in their red-silk stockings and black-velvet
breeches, were like two sticks: people who saw
him go by whispered about him and said all the poor
little fellow’s rank and riches would not keep him long
in the land of the living. Once the little Earl heard
that said, and understood what it meant, and thought
to himself, “I shouldn’t mind dying if I could take
Ralph: perhaps there would be somebody to play with
there.”</p>

<p>It was May, and there were not many folks at
Shanklin: still, there were two or three children he
might have played with, but his grandmamma thought
them vulgar children, not fit playmates for him; and
so the poor little Earl, with the burden of his greatness,
had to walk soberly and sadly past them, with
his little tired red-stockinged legs, while the little girls
said to each other, in a whisper, “There’s a little lord!”
and the boys hallooed out, “He’s the swell that owns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the schooner.” Bertie would sigh, as he heard: what
was the use of owning the schooner, when you had no
one to play with on it, and never could do what you
liked?</p>

<p>You have never seen Shanklin, for you have never
been in England; and if you do go now, you will
never see it as it was when Bertie walked there, when
it was the prettiest and most primitive little place in
England; now, they tell me, it has been made into a
watering-place, with a pier and an esplanade.</p>

<p>Shanklin used to be a little green mossy village covered
up in honeysuckle and hawthorn; low long houses,
green too with ivy and creepers, hid themselves away
in sweet-smelling old-fashioned gardens; yellow roads
ran between high banks and hedges out to the green
down or downward to the ripple of the sea; and the
cool brown sands, glistening and firm, twice a day felt
the kiss of the tide. The cliffs were brown too, for the
most part; some were white; the gray sea stretched in
front; and the glory of the place was its leafy chine
and ravine that severed the rocks and was full of
foliage and of the sound of birds. It used to be all
so quiet there; now and then there passed in the offing
a brig or a yacht or a man-of-war; now and then
farmers’ carts came in from the downs by Appuldurcombe
or the farms beyond the Undercliff; there were
some fishing-cabins by the beach, and one old inn with
a long grassy garden, where the coaches used to stop
that ran through the quiet country from Ryde to
Ventnor. It was so green, so still, so friendly, so
fresh when I think of it I hear the swish of its lazy
waves and I smell the smell of its eglantine hedges,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and I see the big brown eyes of my gallant dog as he
came breathless up from the sea.</p>

<p>Alas! you will never see it so. The hedges are
down, they tell me, and the grand dog is dead, and the
hateful engine tears through the fields, and the sands
are beaten to make an esplanade, and the beach is
noisy and hideous with the bray of bands and the
laughter of fools.</p>

<p>What will the world be like when you are twenty?
Very frightful, I fear. This is progress, they say?</p>

<p>But what of the little Earl? you ask.</p>

<p>Well, the little Earl knew Shanklin as I knew it,—when
the blackbirds and thrushes sang in the quiet
chine, and the sense of an infinite peace dwelt on its
simple shores. His grandmamma had taken for the
summer the house that stands in its woods at the head
of the chine and looks straight down that rift of
greenery to the gray sea. I know not what that house
is now; then it was charming, chalet-like, yet spacious.</p>

<p>Here the little Earl was set free of his studies and
kept out in the air when it was fine, and when it
rained was sent, not to his books, but to his toys. Yet
it did not seem to him any great change; for when he
rode, James was with him; and when he walked,
Deborah was with him; and when he bathed, William
was with him; and when he was only in the garden,
there was grandmamma.</p>

<p>He was never alone. Oh, how he longed to be alone
sometimes! And he never had any playfellows: how
he would watch those two or three vulgar little boys
building sand-castles and sailing their boats! He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
would have given all his big schooner and its crew to
be one of those little boys.</p>

<p>He had a cruise now and then off the island, and the
skipper came up bare-headed and hoped my lord enjoyed
the sail; but he did not enjoy it: William and
Deborah were always after him, telling him to mind
this, and take care of that, till he wished his pretty
snow-white sailor dress with the gold buttons were
only rags and tatters! For the poor little Earl was
an adventurous and curious little lad at heart, and had
a spirit of his own, though he was so meek; and he
was tired of being treated like a baby.</p>

<p>His eighth birthday came round in June, and wonderful
and magnificent were the presents he had sent
him; but he only felt a little more tired than he had
done before; the bonbons he was not allowed to eat,
the splendidly-bound books seemed nonsense to a little
classic who read Livy; the toys he did not care for,
and the gold dressing-case his grandmamma gave him
was no pleasure: he had one in silver, and his very
hair he was never permitted to brush himself.</p>

<p>“As I may not eat the bonbons, might I send them
all to the children on the sands?” he asked wistfully
of his grandmother.</p>

<p>“Impossible, my love,” she answered. “We do not
know who they are.”</p>

<p>“May I give them to the poor children then?” said
the little lad.</p>

<p>“That would hardly be wise, dear. It would give
them a taste for luxuries.”</p>

<p>Bertie sighed: life on this his eighth birthday seemed
very empty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why are people strangers to each other? Why
does not everybody speak to every one else?” he said
at last, desperately. “St. Paul says we are all brothers,
and St. Francis——”</p>

<p>“My dear child, do not talk nonsense,” said Lady
Avillion. “We shall have you a Radical when you
are of age!”</p>

<p>“What is that?” said Bertie.</p>

<p>“The people who slew your dear Charles the First
were Radicals,” said his grandmother, cleverly.</p>

<p>He was discouraged and silent. He went sorrowfully
and leaned against one of the windows and looked
down the green vista of the chine. It was raining, and
they would not let him go out of doors. He thought
to himself, “What use is it calling me ‘my lord,’ and
telling me I own so much, and bowing down before
me, if I may never do once, just once, as I like? I
know I am a little boy; but then, if I am an Earl, if
I am good enough to be <i>that</i>, I ought to be able to do
once as I like. Else, if not, what is the use? And
why does the skipper say always to me, ‘Your lordship
is owner here’?”</p>

<p>And then a fancy came into his little head. Was
he like the Princes in the Tower? Was he a prisoner,
after all? His little mind was full of the pageant of
history, and he made his mind up now that he was a
princely captive watched and warded.</p>

<p>“Tell me, dear Deb,” he said, catching his nurse
by the sleeve as she turned from his bed that night,
“tell me, is it not true that I am in prison, though
you are all kind to me; that somebody else wants
my throne?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Nurse Deborah thought he was “off his head,” and
ran to the physician for a cooling draught, and sat up
in fright all the night, not even reassured by his sound
tranquil sleep.</p>

<p>Bertie asked her nothing more.</p>

<p>He was more sure than ever that a captive he was,
kept in kindly and honorable durance, like James of
Scotland in the Green Tower.</p>

<p>Whilst he was lying awake, a grand and startling
idea dawned on him: What if he were to go out and
see the world for himself? This notion has fascinated
many a child before him. Did not St. Teresa of Spain,
when she was a little thing, toddle out with a tiny
brother over the brown sierras? So absolutely now
did this enterprise dazzle and conquer the little Earl
that before night was half-way over he had persuaded
himself that a prisoner he <i>was</i>, and that his stolen
kingdom he would go and find, just as the knights in
his favorite tales sallied forth to seek the Holy Grail.
The passion for adventure, for escape, for finding out
the truth, grew so strong on him that at the first flush
of daybreak he slid out of bed and resolved that go
alone he would. He longed to take Ralph, but he
feared it would not be right: who knew what perils or
pains awaited him?—and to make the dog sharer in
them seemed selfish. So he threw a glove of his own
for Ralph to guard, bade him be still, and set about
his own flight.</p>

<p>He made a sad bungle of dressing himself, for he
had never clothed himself in his life; but at last he
got the things on somehow, and most of them hind-part-before.
But he did it all without awaking Deborah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and, taking his sailor-hat, he managed to drop
out of the window on to the sward below without any
one being aware.</p>

<p>It was quite early day; the sky was red, the shadows
and the mists were still there, the birds were piping
good-morrow to each other.</p>

<p>“How lovely it is!” he thought. “Oh, why doesn’t
everybody get up at sunrise?”</p>

<p>He knew, however, that if he wanted to see the
world by himself he must not tarry there and think
about the dawn. So off he set, as fast as his not very
strong legs could carry him, and he got down to the
shore.</p>

<p>The fog was on the sea and screened it from his
sight, and there was no one on the beach except a boy
getting nets ready in an old boat. To the boy ran
Bertie, and held to him two half-crowns. “Will you
row me to Bonchurch for that?” he asked.</p>

<p>The boy grinned. “For sure, little master; and
I’d like to row a dozen at the price.”</p>

<p>Into the boat jumped the little Earl, with all the
feverish agility given to prisoners, who are escaping,
by their freed instincts. It was a very old, dirty boat,
and soiled his pretty white clothes terribly, but he had
no eyes for that, he so enjoyed that delicious sense of
being all alone and doing just as he liked. The boy
was a big boy and strong, and rowed with a will; and
the old tub went jumping and bobbing and splashing
through the rather heavy swell. The gig of his yacht
was a smart, long boat, beautifully clean, and with
rowers all dressed in red caps and white jerseys; but
the little Earl had never enjoyed rowing in <i>that</i> half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
so much. There had been always somebody to look
after him and say, “Don’t lean over the side,” or,
“Mind the water does not splash you,” or, “Take
care!” Oh, that tiresome “Take care!” It makes a
boy want to jump head-foremost into the sea, or fling
himself head-downwards from the nearest apple-tree!
I know you have felt so yourself twenty times a week,
though I do not tell you that you were right.</p>

<p>Nothing is prettier than the Undercliff as you look
up at it from the sea,—a tangle of myrtle and laurel
and beech and birch coming down to the very shore,
all as Nature made it. Bertie, as the boat wabbled
along like a fat old duck, looked up at it and was enchanted,
and then he looked at the white wall of mist
on the waters, and was enchanted too. It was like
Wonderland. His dreams were broken by the fisher-lad’s
voice:</p>

<p>“I’ll have to put you ashore at the creek, little master,
and get back, or daddy’ll give me a hiding.”</p>

<p>“Who is ‘daddy’?”</p>

<p>“Father,” said the boy. “He’ll lick me, for the
tub’s his’n.”</p>

<p>Bertie was perplexed. He had heard of bears being
licked into shape by their fathers and mothers, but this
boy, though rough and rather shapeless, looked too old
for such treatment.</p>

<p>“You were a wicked boy to use the boat, then,” he
said, with great severity.</p>

<p>The lad only grinned.</p>

<p>“Little master, you tipped me a crown.”</p>

<p>“I did not mean to tempt you to do wrong,” said
Bertie very seriously still; and then he colored, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
was he very sure that he was not doing wrong himself?</p>

<p>The old boat was grinding on the shingle then, and
the rower of it was putting him ashore at a little creek
that was wooded and pretty, and up which the sea ran
at high tide; there was a little cottage at the head of
it. I have heard that this wood-glen used to be in the
old time a very famous place for smugglers, and it is
still solitary and romantic, or at least was so still
when the little Earl was set down there. “Where
am I?” he asked the boy. But the wicked boy
only grinned, and began to wabble back through the
water as fast as his long slashing strokes could carry
him. The little Earl felt rather foolish and rather
helpless.</p>

<p>He was not far on his way towards seeing the world,
and he began to wish for some breakfast. There was
smoke going out of a chimney of the cottage, and the
door of it stood open, but he was afraid the people there
might stop him if he asked for anything, and, besides,
the path up to it through the glen looked rocky and
thorny and impassable, so he kept along by the beach,
finding it heavy walking, for there were more stones
than sands, and the beach was strewn with rocks, large
and small, and stiff prickly furze. But he had the sea
beside him and the world before him, and he walked
on bravely, and in a little while he came into Bonchurch.
It was very early yet, and Bonchurch was
asleep, and most of its snug thatched houses, hidden
away in their gardens and fuchsia hedges, were shut
up snugly; the tall trees of its one street made a deep
shadow in it, and the broad placid water of its great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
pool was green with their reflection: it was a sweet,
quiet place, leafy as any haunt for fairies, yet on the
very edge of the sea.</p>

<p>At a baker’s shop, a woman was lifting down the
shutters. The little Earl took his hat off very prettily
and said to her,—</p>

<p>“If you please, will you be kind enough to sell me
some bread-and-milk?”</p>

<p>The woman stared, then laughed.</p>

<p>“Lord bless your pretty face! I only sell bread, but
I’ll give you some milk in, for sake of your pinched
cheeks. Come along inside, little gentleman.”</p>

<p>He went inside; it seemed a very funny place to
him, so small and so dark, and so dusty with flour;
but the smell of baking was sweet, and he was hungry.</p>

<p>She bustled about a little, and set before him a bowl
of bread-and-milk, with a wooden spoon to eat it with.
The little Earl put his hand in his pocket to pay for it;
lo! he had not a farthing!</p>

<p>He turned very red, and then very white, and thought
to himself that the money must have tumbled into the
sea with his watch, which was missing too.</p>

<p>It did not occur to him that the wicked boy had
taken both; yet such was the sad fact.</p>

<p>He rose, very sorrowful and confused and ashamed.</p>

<p>“Madam, I beg your pardon,” he said, in his little
ceremonious way: “I thought I had money, but I
have lost it. Thank you very much, but I cannot
take the food.”</p>

<p>The woman was good-natured and shrewd.</p>

<p>“Lord! sup it up, my dear little gentleman,” she
said to him. “You are welcome to it,—right welcome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
you are; and your pa and your ma can pay for
it.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” murmured Bertie, getting very red; and,
fearing lest his longing for the meal should overcome
his honor, he stumbled out of the baking-house door
and ran up the tree-shadowed road faster than ever he
had run in his life.</p>

<p>To be sure, he had plenty of money of his own;
they all said so; but he never knew well where it was,
or what it meant; and, besides, he intended never to
go back to his grandmother and Deborah and Ralph
and Royal any more, till he had found out the truth
and seen his kingdom.</p>

<p>So he ran on through Bonchurch and out of it, leaving
its pleasant green shade with a little sigh, half of
impatience, half of hunger. He did not go on by the
sea, for he knew by hearsay that this way would take
him to Ventnor, and he was afraid people in a town
would know him and stop him; so he set forth inland,
where the deep lanes delve through the grassy downs,
and here, sitting on a stile, the little Earl saw the
ploughboy eating something white and round and big
that he himself had never seen before.</p>

<p>“It must be something very delicious to make him
enjoy it so much,” thought the little Earl, and then
curiosity entered so into him, and he longed so much
to taste this wonderful unknown thing, that he went
up to the boy and said to him,—</p>

<p>“Will you be so kind as to let me know what you
are eating?”</p>

<p>The ploughboy grinned from ear to ear.</p>

<p>“For certain, little zurr,” he said, with a burr and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
a drawl in his speech, and he gave the thing to Bertie,
which was neither more nor less than a peeled turnip.</p>

<p>The little Earl looked at it doubtfully, for he did
not much fancy what the other had handled with
his big brown hands and bitten with his big yellow
teeth. But then, to enjoy anything as much as that
other had enjoyed it, and to taste something quite
unknown!—this counterbalanced his disgust and over-ruled
his delicacy. One side of the great white thing
was unbitten; he took an eager tremulous little bite
out of that.</p>

<p>“But, oh!” he cried in dismay as he tasted, “it has
no taste at all, and what there is is nasty!”</p>

<p>“Turnips is main good,” said the boy.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>no!</i>” said the little Earl, with intense horror;
and he threw the turnip down amongst the grass, and
went away sorely puzzled.</p>

<p>“Little master,” roared Hodge after him, “I’ll bet
as you aren’t hungry.”</p>

<p>That was it, of course.</p>

<p>The little Earl was not really hungry,—never had
been really hungry in all his life. But this explanation
of natural philosophy did not occur to him, not
even when the boy hallooed it after him. He only said
to himself, “How can that boy eat that filthy thing?
and he really did look as if he liked it so!”</p>

<p>Presently, after trotting a mile or so, he passed a
little shop set all by itself at the end of a lane,—surely
the tiniest, loneliest shop in Great Britain. But a
cheery-looking old woman kept it, and he saw it had
bread in it, as well as many other stuffs, and tin canisters
that were to him incomprehensible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you please,” he said, rather timidly, offering the
gold anchor off the ribbon of his hat, “I have lost my
money, and could you be so kind as to give me any
breakfast for this?”</p>

<p>The old woman smelt the anchor, bit it, twinkled
her eyes, and then drew a long face. “It ain’t worth
tuppence, master,” she said; “but ye’re mighty small
to be out by yourself, and puny like: I don’t say as
how I won’t feed yer.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Bertie, who did not know at all
what his anchor was worth.</p>

<p>“Come in out o’ dust,” said the old woman, smartly,
and then she bustled about and set him down in her
little den to milk, bread, and some cold bacon.</p>

<p>That he had no appetite was the despair of his people
and physician at home, and cod-liver oil, steel, quinine,
and all manner of nastiness had been administered to
provoke hunger in him, with no effect: by this time,
however, he had almost as much hunger as the boy who
had munched the turnip.</p>

<p>Nothing had ever tasted to him half so good in his
life.</p>

<p>The old woman eyed him curiously. “You’s a
runaway,” she thought; “but I’ll not raise the
cry after ye, or they’ll come spying about this bit o’
gold.”</p>

<p>She said to herself that the child would come to no
harm, and when a while had gone by she would step
over to Ryde or Newport and get a guinea on the
brooch.</p>

<p>Her little general shop was not a very prosperous
business, though useful to the field-folk; and sanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
her sugar, and putting clay in her mustard, and adding
melted fat to her butter, had not strengthened her moral
principles.</p>

<p>As Bertie was eating, there came a very thin, scantily-clad,
miserable-looking woman, who held out a halfpenny.
“A sup o’ milk for Susy, missus,” she said, in
a very pitiful faint voice.</p>

<p>“How be Sue?” asked the mistress of the shop.
The woman shook her head with tears running down
her hollow cheeks.</p>

<p>“My boy he’s gone in spinney,” she murmured, “to
try and catch summat, if he can: will you change it,
missus, if he git a good bird?”</p>

<p>The old woman winked, frowned, and glanced at
Bertie.</p>

<p>“Birds aren’t good eatin’ on fust of July,” she observed,
as she handed the milk. The woman paid the
halfpenny and hurried away with the milk.</p>

<p>“I think that woman is very poor,” said Bertie,
questioningly and solemnly.</p>

<p>The old dame chuckled.</p>

<p>“No doubts o’ that, master.”</p>

<p>“Then you are cruel to take her money: you should
have <i>given</i> her the milk.”</p>

<p>“Ho, ho, little sir! be you a parson in a gownd?
I’m mappen poor as she, and <i>she</i> hiv desarved all she
gits, for her man he were a poacher, and he died in jail
last Jannivery.”</p>

<p>“A poacher!” said Bertie, with the natural instinctive
horror of a landed gentleman. “And her
son was going to snare a bird!” he cried, with light
breaking in on him; “and you would give them things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
in exchange for the bird! Oh, what a very cruel,
what a very <i>wicked</i> woman you are!”</p>

<p>For an answer she shied at him a round wooden
trencher, which missed its aim and struck a basket of
eggs and smashed them, and one of the panes of her
shop-window as well.</p>

<p>Bertie got up and walked slowly out of the door,
keeping his eyes upon her.</p>

<p>“When I see a magistrate, I shall tell him about
you,” he said, solemnly: “you tempt poor people: that
is very dreadful.”</p>

<p>The enraged woman, in her outraged feelings, threw
a pail of dirty water after him, some of which splashed
him and completed the disfigurement of his white suit.
He looked up and down to see for the poor woman with
the milk, that he might console her poverty and open
her eyes to her sins; but she was not within sight; and
Bertie reflected that if he stopped to correct other
people’s errors he should never see the world and find
his kingdom.</p>

<p>He had eaten a hearty meal, and his spirits rose and
his heart was full of hope and valor; and if he had
only had Ralph with him, he would have been quite
happy.</p>

<p>So he went away valorously across a broad rolling
down, and about half a mile farther on he came to a
little shed. In the shed were a fire, and a man, and a
pig; in the fire was an iron, and the pig was tied by a
rope to a ring. Bertie saw the man take the red-hot
iron and go up to the pig: Bertie’s face grew blanched
with horror.</p>

<p>“Stop, stop! what are you doing to the pig?” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
screamed, as he ran in to the man, who looked up and
stared.</p>

<p>“I be branding the pig. Get out, or I’ll brand
you!” he cried. Bertie held his ground; his eyes
were flashing.</p>

<p>“You wicked, wicked man! Do you not know that
poor pig was made by God?”</p>

<p>“Dunno,” said the wretch, with a grin. “She’ll be
eat by men, come Candlemas! I be marking of her,
’cos I’ll turn her out on the downs with t’other. Git
out, youngster! you’ve no call here.”</p>

<p>Bertie planted himself firmly on his feet, and doubled
his little fists.</p>

<p>“I will not see you do such a cruelty to a poor dumb
thing,” he said, while he grew white as death, “<i>I will
not.</i>”</p>

<p>The man scowled and yet grinned.</p>

<p>“Will you beat me, little Hop-o’-my-thumb?”</p>

<p>Bertie put himself before the poor black pig, who
was squealing from mere fright and the scorch of the
fire.</p>

<p>“You shall not get the pig without killing me first.
You are a cruel man.”</p>

<p>The man grew angry.</p>

<p>“Tell you what, youngster: I’ve a mind to try the
jumping-irons on you for your impudence. You look
like a drowned white kitten. Clear off, if you don’t
want to taste something right red hot.”</p>

<p>Bertie’s whole body grew sick, but he did not move
and he did not quail.</p>

<p>“I would rather you did it to me than to this poor
thing,” he answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m blowed!” said the man, relaxing his wrath
from sheer amazement. “Well, you’re a good plucked
one, you are.”</p>

<p>“I do not know what you mean,” said Bertie, a little
haughtily; “but you shall not hurt the pig.”</p>

<p>“Darn me!” yelled the man; “I’ll burn you, sure
as you live, if you don’t kneel on your bare bones and
beg my pardon.”</p>

<p>“I will not do that.”</p>

<p>“You won’t beg my pardon for cheeking me?”</p>

<p>“No: you are a wicked man.”</p>

<p>Bertie’s eyes closed; he grew faint; he fully believed
that in another instant he would feel the hissing fire
of the brand. But he did not yield.</p>

<p>The man’s hand dropped to his side.</p>

<p>“You <i>are</i> a plucked one,” he said, once more.
“Lord, child, it was a joke. You’re such a rare game
un, to humor you, there, I’ll let the crittur go without
marking her. But you’re a rare little fool, if you’re
not an angel down from on high.”</p>

<p>Bertie’s eyes filled with tears. He held his hand out
royally to be kissed, as he was used to do at Avillion.</p>

<p>The big, black-looking man crushed it in his own
brown paw.</p>

<p>“My! you’re a game un!” he muttered, with
wonder and awe.</p>

<p>“And you will never, never, never burn pigs any
more?” said Bertie, searching his face with his own
serious large eyes.</p>

<p>“I’ll ne’er brand this un,” said the man, with a
shamefaced laugh. “Lord, little sir, you’re the first
is ever got as much as that out of me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“But you <i>never</i> must do it,” said Bertie, solemnly.
“It is wicked of you, and God is angry; and it is
very mean for you, such a big man and so strong,
to hurt a defenceless dumb thing. You must <i>never</i>
do it.”</p>

<p>“What is your name, little master?” said the big
man, humbly.</p>

<p>“They call me Avillion.”</p>

<p>“William? Then I’ll say William all the days of
my life at my prayers o’ Sundays,” said the man, with
some emotion, and murmured to himself, “Such a game
un I never seed.”</p>

<p>“Thanks very much,” said Bertie, gently, and then
he lifted his hat politely, and went out of the shed
before the man could recover from his astonishment.
When the little Earl looked back, he saw the giant
pouring water on the fire, and the pig was loose.</p>

<p>“I <i>was</i> afraid,” thought Bertie. “But he should
have burnt me all up every bit: I never would have
given in.”</p>

<p>And something seemed to say in his ear, “The
loveliest thing in all the world is courage that goes
hand in hand with mercy; and these two together can
work miracles, like magicians.”</p>

<p>By this time Bertie, except for a certain inalienable
grace and refinement that were in his little face and
figure, had few marks of a young gentleman. His
snowy serge was smirched and stained with blackberries;
his red stockings, from the sea-water and the
field-mud, had none of their original color; his hat
had been bent and crumpled by his fall, and his hair
was rough. Nobody passing him could have dreamt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
that this sorry wanderer was a little earl. Nevertheless,
when he had been dressed in his little court suit
and had been taken to see the queen once at Balmoral,
he had never been a quarter so proud nor a tenth part
so happy. He longed to meet Cromwell, and Richard
the Third, and Gessler, and Nero. He began to feel
like all the knights he had ever read of, and those
were many.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 434px;">
<img src="images/i-213.jpg" width="434" height="600" alt="boy in white suit with red trim talking to crying girl" />
<div class="caption">“LITTLE GIRL, WHY DO YOU CRY?” HE SAID</div>
</div>

<p>Presently he saw a little maiden weeping. She was
an ugly little maiden, with a shock head of red hair,
and a wide mouth, and a brickdust skin; but she was
crying. In his present heroic mood, he could not pass
her by unconsoled.</p>

<p>“Little girl, why do you cry?” he said, stopping in
the narrow green lane.</p>

<p>She looked at him out of a sharp little eye, and her
face puckered up afresh.</p>

<p>“I’se going to schule, little master!”</p>

<p>“To school, do you mean? And why does that
make you cry? Can you read?”</p>

<p>“Naw,” said the maiden, and sobbed loudly.</p>

<p>“Then why are you not glad to go and learn?” said
Bertie, in his superior wisdom.</p>

<p>“There’s naebody to do nowt at home,” said the red-haired
one, with a howl. “Mother’s abed sick, and
Tam’s hurt his leg, and who’ll mind baby? He’ll
tumble the kittle o’er hisself, I know he will, and
he’ll be scalt to death, ’ll baby!”</p>

<p>“Dear, dear!” said Bertie, sympathetically. “But
why do you go to school then?”</p>

<p>“’Cos I isn’t thirteen,” sobbed the shock-haired
nymph: “I’se only ten. And daddy was had up las<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>’
week and pit in prison ’cos he kept me at home. And
if I ain’t at home, who’ll mind baby, and who’ll bile
the taters, and who’ll——? Oh, how I wish I was
thirteen!”</p>

<p>Bertie did not understand. He had never heard of
the School Board.</p>

<p>“What does your father do?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Works i’ brick-field. All on us work i’ brick-field.
I can take baby to brick-field; he sit in the
clay beautiful, but they awn’t let me take him to
schule, and he’ll be scalt, I know he’ll be scalt. He’ll
allers get a-nigh the kittle if he can.”</p>

<p>“But it is very shocking not to know how to read,”
said the little Earl, very gravely. “You should have
learned that as soon as you could speak. I did.”</p>

<p>“Maybe yours aren’t brick-field folk,” said the little
girl, stung by her agony to sarcasm. “I’ve allers had
a baby to mind, ever since I toddled; first ’twas Tam,
and then ’twas Dick, and now ’tis this un. I dunno
want to read; awn’t make bricks a-readin’.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you will learn such beautiful things,” said
Bertie. “I do think, you know, that you <i>ought</i> to go
to school.”</p>

<p>“So the gemman said as pit dad in th’ lock-up,” said
the recalcitrant one, doggedly. “Butiful things aren’t
o’ much count, sir, when one’s belly’s empty. I oodn’t
go to the blackguds now, if ’tweren’t as poor dad says
as how I must, ’cos they lock him up.”</p>

<p>“It seems very hard to lock him up,” said Bertie,
with increasing sympathy; “and I think you ought to
obey him and go. I will see if I can find the baby.
Where do you live?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>She pointed vaguely over the copses and pastures:
“Go on a mile, and you’ll see Jim Bracken’s cottage;
but, Lord love you! <i>you</i>’ll ne’er manage baby.”</p>

<p>“I will try,” said Bertie, sweetly. His fancy as well
as his charity was stirred; for he had never, that he
knew of, seen a baby. “But indeed you should go to
school.”</p>

<p>“I’m a-going,” said the groaning and blowsy heroine
with a last sob, and then she set off running as
quickly as a pair of her father’s boots, ten times too
large, allowed her, her slate and her books making a
loud clatter as she struggled on her way.</p>

<p>He was by this time very tired, for he was not used
to such long walks; but curiosity and compassion put
fresh spirit into his heart, and his small legs pegged
valorously over the rough ground, the red stockings
and the silver buckles becoming by this time much
begrimed with mud.</p>

<p>He knocked at one cottage door, and saw only a
very cross old woman, who flourished a broom at him.</p>

<p>“No, it bean’t Jim Bracken’s. Get you gone!—you
look like a runaway.”</p>

<p>Now, a runaway he was; and, as truth when we are
guilty is always even as a two-edged sword, Bertie
colored up to the roots of his hair, and bolted off as
fast as he could to the only other cottage visible, beyond
a few acres of mangel-wurzel and all the lucern
family, which the little Earl fancied were shamrocks.
For he was far on in Euclid, could speak German well,
and could spell through Tacitus fairly, but about the
flowers of the field and the grasses no one had ever
thought it worth while to tell him anything at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Indeed, to tell you the truth, I do not think his tutors
knew anything about them themselves.</p>

<p>This other cottage was so low, so covered up in its
broken thatch, which in turn was covered with lichen,
and was so tumble-down and sorrowful-looking, that
Bertie thought it was a ruined cow-shed. However,
it stood where the school-girl had pointed: so he took
his courage in both hands, as we say in French, and
advanced to it. The rickety door stood open, and he
saw a low miserable bed with a miserable woman lying
on it; a shock-headed boy sprawled on the floor, another
crouched before a fire of brambles and sods, and
between the legs of this last boy was a strange, uncouth,
shapeless object, which, but for the fact that it was
crying loudly, never would have appeared to his astonished
eyes as the baby for whom was prophesied a
tragic and early end by the kettle. The boy who had
this object in charge stared with two little round eyes.</p>

<p>“Mamsey, there’s a young gemman,” he said, in an
awed voice.</p>

<p>Bertie took off his hat, and went into the room with
his prettiest grace.</p>

<p>“If you please, are you very ill?” he said, in his
little soft voice, to the woman in bed. “I met—I
met—a little girl who was so anxious about the baby,
and I said I would come and see if I could be of any
use——”</p>

<p>The woman raised herself on one elbow, and looked
at him with eager, haggard eyes.</p>

<p>“Lord, little sir, there’s naught to be done for us;—leastways,
unless you had a shillin’ or two——”</p>

<p>“I have no money,” murmured Bertie, feeling very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
unlike a little earl in that moment. The woman gave
a weary angry sigh and sank back indifferent.</p>

<p>“Can I do nothing?” said Bertie, wistfully.</p>

<p>“By golly!” said the boy on the floor, “unless you’ve
got a few coppers, little master——”</p>

<p>“Coppers?” repeated the little Earl.</p>

<p>“Pence,” said the boy, shortly; then the baby began
to howl, and the boy shook it.</p>

<p>“Do please not make it scream so,” said Bertie.
“That is what you call the baby, is it not?”</p>

<p>“Iss,” said the boy Dick, sullenly. “This here’s
baby, cuss him! and what bisness be he of yourn?”</p>

<p>For interference without coppers to follow was a
barren intruder that he was disposed to resent.</p>

<p>“I thought I could amuse him,” said Bertie, timidly.
“I told your sister I would.”</p>

<p>Dick roared into loud guffaws.</p>

<p>“Baby’d kick you into middle o’ next week, you
poor little puny spindle-shanks!” said this rude boy;
and Bertie felt that he was very rude, though he had
no idea what was meant by spindle-shanks.</p>

<p>The other boy, who was lying on his stomach,—a
sadly empty little stomach,—here reversed his position
and stared up at Bertie.</p>

<p>“I think you’re a kind little gemman,” he said,
“and Dick’s cross ’cos he’s broke his legs, and we’ve
had no vittles since yesternoon, and only a sup o’ tea
Peg made afore she went, and mother’s main bad, that
she be.”</p>

<p>And tears rolled down this gentler little lad’s dirty
cheeks.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, what shall I do?” said Bertie, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
sigh: if he had only had the money and the watch
that had fallen into the sea! He looked round him
and felt very sick; it was all so dirty, so dirty!—and
he had never seen dirt before; and the place smelt
very close and sour, and the children’s clothes were
mere rags, and the woman was all skin and bone, on
her wretched straw bed; and the unhappy baby was
screaming loudly enough to be heard right across the
sea to the French coast.</p>

<p>“Baby, poor baby, don’t cry so!” said Bertie, very
softly, and he dangled the ends of his red sash before
its tearful eyes, and shook them up and down: the attention
of the baby was arrested, it ceased to howl, and
put out its hands, and began to laugh instead! Bertie
was very proud of his success, and even the sullen Dick
muttered, “Well, I never!”</p>

<p>The little Earl undid his scarf and let the baby pull
it towards itself. Dick’s eyes twinkled greedily.</p>

<p>“Master, that’d <i>sell</i> for summat!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you must not sell it,” said the little Earl,
eagerly. “It is to amuse the poor baby. And what
pretty big eyes he has! how he laughs!”</p>

<p>“Your shoes ’ud sell,” muttered Dick.</p>

<p>“Dick! don’t, Dick! that’s begging,” muttered Tam.
Bertie stared in surprise. To sell his shoes seemed as
odd as to be asked to sell his hair or his hands. The
woman opened her fading, glazing eyes.</p>

<p>“They’re honest boys, little sir: you’ll pardon of
’em; they’ve eat nothing since yesternoon, and then
’twas only a carrot or two, and boys is main hungry.”</p>

<p>“And have you nothing?” said Bertie, aghast at the
misery in this unknown world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“How’d we have anything?” said the sick woman,
grimly. “They’ve locked up my man, and Peg’s sent
to school while we starve; and nobody earns nothin’,
for Dick’s broke his leg, and I’ve naught in my breasts
for baby——”</p>

<p>“But would not somebody you work for—or the
priest—?” began Bertie.</p>

<p>“Passon don’t do nowt for us,—my man’s a Methody;
and at brick-field they don’t mind us; if we be
there, well an’ good,—we work and get paid; and if
we isn’t there, well—some un else is. That’s all.”
Then she sank back, gasping.</p>

<p>Bertie stood woe-begone and perplexed.</p>

<p>“Did you say my shoes would sell?” he murmured,
very miserably, his mind going back to the history of
St. Martin and the cloak.</p>

<p>Dick brightened up at once.</p>

<p>“Master, I’ll get three shillin’ on ’em, maybe more,
down in village yonder.”</p>

<p>“You mus’n’t take the little gemman’s things,” murmured
the mother, feebly; but faintness was stealing
on her, and darkness closing over her sight.</p>

<p>“Three shillings!” said Bertie, who knew very little
of the value of shillings; “that seems very little! I
<i>think</i> they cost sovereigns. Could you get a loaf of
bread with three shillings?”</p>

<p>“Gu-r-r-r!” grinned Dick, and Bertie understood
that the guttural sound meant assent and rapture.</p>

<p>“But I cannot walk without shoes.”</p>

<p>“Walk! yah! ye’ll walk better. We niver have no
shoes,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Don’t you, <i>really?</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Golly! no! Ye’ll walk ten times finer; ye won’t
trip, nor stumble, nor nothin’, and ye’ll run as fast
again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I shall not,” murmured Bertie, and he was
going to say that he would be ashamed to be seen without
shoes, only he remembered that, as these boys had
none, that would not be kind. A desperate misery
came over him at the thought of being shoeless, but
then he reasoned with himself, “To give was no
charity if it cost you nothing: did not the saints strip
themselves to the uttermost shred for the poor?”</p>

<p>He stooped and took off his shoes with the silver
buckles on them, and placed them hastily on the floor.</p>

<p>“Take them, if they will get you bread,” he said,
with the color mounting in his face.</p>

<p>Dick seized them with a yell of joy. “Tarnation
that I can’t go mysel’. Here, Tam, run quick and sell
’em to old Nan; and get bread, and meat, and potatoes,
and milk for baby, and Lord knows what; p’raps a gill
of gin for mammy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think we ought to rob little master,
Dick,” murmured little Tam. His brother hurled a
crutch at him, and Tam snatched up the pretty shoes
and fled.</p>

<p>“My blazes, sir,” said Dick, with rather a shamefaced
look, “if you’d a beast like a lot of fire gnawing
at your belly all night long, yer wouldn’t stick at nowt
to get bread.”</p>

<p>Bertie only imperfectly comprehended. The baby,
tired of the sash, began to cry again; and Dick, grown
good-natured, danced it up and down.</p>

<p>“How old are you?” said Bertie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nigh on eight,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” sighed the little Earl; this rough, masterful,
coarse-tongued boy seemed like a grown man to
him.</p>

<p>“You won’t split on us?” said Dick, sturdily.</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked Bertie.</p>

<p>“Not tell anybody you give us the shoes: there’d be
a piece of work.”</p>

<p>“As if one <i>told</i> when one did any kindness!” murmured
Bertie, with a disgust he could not quite conceal.
“I mean, when one does one’s duty.”</p>

<p>“But what’ll you gammon ’em with at home?—they’ll
want to know what you’ve done with your
shoes.”</p>

<p>“I am not going home,” said the little Earl, and
there was a something in the way he spoke that silenced
Dick’s tongue,—which he would have called his clapper.</p>

<p>“What in the world be the little swell arter?”
thought Dick.</p>

<p>Bertie meanwhile, with some awe and anxiety, was
watching the livid face of the sick woman: he had
never seen illness or death, but it seemed to him that
she was very ill indeed.</p>

<p>“Are you not anxious about your mother?” he asked
of the rough boy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dick, sulkily, with the water coming
in his eyes. “Dad’s in the lock-up: that’s wuss still,
young sir.”</p>

<p>“Not worse than death,” said Bertie, solemnly. “He
will come back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’ll come round with a drop of gin and a sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of broth,” said Dick, confidently. “’Tis all hunger and
frettin’, hers is.”</p>

<p>“I am glad I gave my shoes,” thought Bertie.
Then there was a long silence, broken only by the
hissing of the green brambles on the fire and the yelps
of the baby.</p>

<p>“Maybe, sir,” said Dick, after a little, “you’d put
the saucepan on? I can’t move with this here leg.
If you’d pit some water out o’ kittle in him, he’ll be
ready for cookin’ when the vittles come.”</p>

<p>“I will do that,” said Bertie, cheerfully, and he set
the saucepan on by lifting it with both hands: it was
very black, and its crock came off on his knickerbockers.
Then, by Dick’s directions, he found a pair
of old wooden bellows, and blew on the sticks and
sods; but this he managed so ill that Dick wriggled
himself along the floor closer to the fire and did it
himself.</p>

<p>“You’re a gaby!” he said to his benefactor.</p>

<p>“What is that?” said Bertie.</p>

<p>But Dick felt that it was more prudent not to explain.</p>

<p>In half an hour Tam burst into the room, breathless
and joyous, his scruples having disappeared under the
basket he bore.</p>

<p>“She gived me five shillin’!” he shouted; “and I’s
sure they’s wuth a deal more, ’cos her eyes twinkled
and winked, and she shoved me a peg-top in!”</p>

<p>“Gie us o’t!” shrieked Dick, in an agony at being
bound to the floor with all these good things before his
sight.</p>

<p>Little Tam, who was very loyal, laid them all out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
on the ground before his elder: two quartern loaves,
two pounds of beef, onions, potatoes, a bit of bacon,
and a jug of milk.</p>

<p>Dick poured some milk into an old tin mug, and
handed it roughly to Bertie.</p>

<p>“Feed the baby, will yer, whiles Tam and me
cooks?”</p>

<p>The little Earl took the can, and advanced to the
formidable bundle of rags, who was screaming like a
very hoarse raven.</p>

<p>“I think you should attend to your mother first,”
he said, gently, as the baby made a grab at the little
tin pot, the look of which it seemed to know, and
shook half the milk over itself.</p>

<p>“Poor mammy!” said Tam, who was gnawing a bit
of bread; and, with his bread in one hand, he got up
and put a little gin and water quite hot between his
mother’s lips. She swallowed it without opening her
eyes or seeming to be conscious, and Tam climbed down
from the bed again with a clear conscience.</p>

<p>“We’ll gie her some broth,” he said, manfully,
while he and Dick, munching bread and raw bacon,
tumbled the beef in a lump into the saucepan, drowned
in water with some whole onions, in the common
fashion of cottage-cooking. The baby, meanwhile, was
placidly swallowing the milk that the little Earl held
for it very carefully, and, when that was done, accepted
a crust that he offered it to suck.</p>

<p>The two boys were crouching before the crackling
fire, munching voraciously, and watching the boiling
of the old black pot. They had quite forgotten their
benefactor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“My! What’ll Peg say when she’s to home?”
chuckled Tam.</p>

<p>“She’ll say that she’d ha’ cooked better,” growled
Dick. “Golly! ain’t the fat good?”</p>

<p>Bertie stood aloof, pleased, and yet sorrowful because
they did not notice him.</p>

<p>Even the baby had so completely centred its mind
in the crust that it had abandoned all memory of the
red scarf.</p>

<p>Bertie looked on a little while, but no one seemed to
remember him. The boys’ eyes were glowing on the
saucepan, and their cheeks were filled out with food as
the cherubs in his chapel at home were puffed out with
air as they blew celestial trumpets.</p>

<p>He went to the door slowly, looked back, and then
retreated into the sunshine.</p>

<p>“It would be mean to put them in mind of me,” he
thought, as he withdrew.</p>

<p>Suddenly a sharp pain shot through him: a stone
had cut his unshod foot.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me! how ever shall I walk without any
shoes or boots!” he thought, miserably; and he was
very nearly bursting out crying.</p>

<p>On the edge of these fields was a wood,—a low,
dark, rolling wood,—which looked to the little Earl,
who missed his own forests, inviting and cool and
sweet. By this time it was getting towards noon, and
the sun was hot, and he felt thirsty and very tired.
He was sad, too: he was glad to have satisfied those
poor hungry children, but their indifference to him
when they were satisfied was chilling and melancholy.</p>

<p>“But then we ought not to do a kindness that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
may be thanked,” he said to himself. “It is a proper
punishment to me, because I wished to be thanked,
which was mean.”</p>

<p>So he settled, as he usually did, that it was all his
own fault.</p>

<p>Happily for him, the ground was soft with summer
dust, and so he managed to get along the little path
that ran from the cottage through the lucern-fields,
and from there the path became grass, which was still
less trying to his little red stockings.</p>

<p>Yet he was anxious and troubled; he felt heavily
weighted for his battle with the world without any
shoes on, and he felt he must look ridiculous. For the
first time, St. Martin did not seem to him so very
much of a hero, because St. Martin’s gift was only a
cloak. Besides, without his sash, the band of his
knickerbockers could be seen; and he was afraid this
was indecent.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he went on bravely, if lamely. Believe
me, nothing sets the world more straight than thinking
that what is awry in it is one’s self.</p>

<p>The wood, which was a well-known spinney famous
for pheasants, was reached before very long, though
with painful effort. It was chiefly composed of old
hawthorn-trees and blackthorn, with here and there a
larch or holly. The undergrowth was thick, and the
sunbeams were playing at bo-peep with the shadows.
Far away over the fields and thorns was a glimmer of
blue water, and close around were all manner of ferns,
of foxgloves, of grasses, of boughs. The tired little
Earl sank downward under one of the old thorns with
feet that bled. A wasp had stung him, too, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
his stocking, and the stung place was smarting furiously.
“But how much more Christ and the saints suffered!”
thought Bertie, seriously and piously, without the
smallest touch of vanity.</p>

<p>Lying on the moss under all that greenery, he felt
refreshed and soothed, although the foot the wasp had
stung throbbed a good deal.</p>

<p>There were all sorts of pretty things to see: the
pheasants, who were lords of the manor till October
came round, did not mind him in the least, and swept
smoothly by with their long tails like court mantles
sweeping the grass. Blackbirds, those cheeriest of all
birds, pecked at worms and grubs quite near him.
Chaffinches were looking for hairs under the brambles
to make their second summer nest with. Any hairs
serve their purpose,—cows’, horses’, or dogs’; and if
they get a tuft of hare-skin or rabbit-fur they are
furnished for the year. A pair of little white-throats
were busy in a low bush, gathering the catch-weed that
grew thickly there, and a goldfinch was flying away
with a lock of sheep’s wool in his beak. There were
other charming creatures, too: a mole was hurrying to
his underground castle, a nuthatch was at work on a
rotten tree-trunk, and a gray, odd-looking bird was
impaling a dead field-mouse on one of the thorn-branches.
Bertie did not know that this gentleman
was but the gray shrike, once used in hawking; indeed,
he did not know the names or habits of any of the
birds; and he lay still hidden in the ferns, and watched
them with delight and mute amazement. There were
thousands of such pretty creatures in his own woods
and brakes at home, but then he was never alone: he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
was always either walking with Father Philip or riding
with William, and in neither case was he allowed to
stop and loiter and lie in the grass, and the sonorous
voice of the priest scattered these timid dwellers in the
greenwood as surely as did the tread of the pony’s
hoofs and the barking of Ralph.</p>

<p>“When I am a man I will pass all my life out of
doors, and I will get friends with all these pretty
things, and ask them what they are doing,” he thought;
and he was so entranced in this new world hidden away
under the low hawthorn boughs of this spinney that he
quite forgot he had lost his shoes and did not know
where he would sleep when night came. He had quite
forgotten his own existence, indeed; and this is just
the happiness that comes to us always, when we learn
to love the winged and four-footed brethren that
Nature has placed so near us, and whom, alas! we so
shamefully neglect when we do not do even worse and
persecute them. Bertie was quite oblivious that he
was a runaway, who had started with a very fine idea
or finding out who it was that kept him in prison, and
giving him battle wherever he might be: he was much
more interested in longing to know what the great gray
shrike was, and why it hung up the mouse on the thorn
and flew away. If you do not know any more than
he did, I may tell you that the shrikes are like your
father, and like their game when it has been many
days in the larder. It is one of the few ignoble tastes
in which birds resemble mankind.</p>

<p>The shrike flew away to look for some more mice,
or frogs, or little snakes, or cockroaches, or beetles, for
he is a very useful fellow indeed in the woods, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the keepers are usually silly and wicked enough to try
and kill him. His home and his young ones were
above in the thicket, and he had stuck all round their
nests insects of all kinds: still, he was a provident
bird, and was of opinion that every one should work
while it is day.</p>

<p>When the shrike flew away after a bumble-bee, the
little Earl fell asleep: what with fatigue, and excitement,
and the heat of the sun, a sound, dreamless
slumber fell upon him there among the birds and the
sweet smell of the May buds; and the goldfinch sang
to him, while he slept, such a pretty song that he
heard it though he was so fast asleep. The goldfinch,
though, did not sing for him one bit in the world; he
sang for his wife, who was sitting among her callow
brood hidden away from sight under the leaves, and
with no greater anxiety on her mind than fear of a
possible weasel or rat gnawing at her nest from the
bottom.</p>

<p>When the little Earl awoke, the sun was not full
and golden all about him as it had been; there were
long shadows slanting through the spinney, and there
was a great globe descending behind the downs of the
western horizon. It was probably about six in the
evening. Bertie could not tell, for, unluckily for him,
he had always had a watch to rely upon, and had never
been taught to tell the hour from the “shepherd’s
hour-glass” in the field-flowers, or calculate the time
of day from the length of the shadows. Even now,
though night was so nigh, the thought of where he
should find a bed did not occur to him, for he was
absorbed in a little boy who stood before him,—a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
miserable little black-haired, brown-cheeked boy, who
was staring hard at him.</p>

<p>“Now, he, I am sure, is as poor as Dick and Tam,”
thought the little Earl, “and I have nothing left to
give him.”</p>

<p>The little boy was endeavoring to hide behind his
back a bright bundle of ruffled feathers, and in his
other hand he held a complicated arrangement of twine
and twigs with a pendent noose.</p>

<p>That Bertie did know the look of, for he had seen
his own keepers destroy such things in his own woods,
and had heard them swear when they did so. So his
land-owner’s instincts awoke in him, though the land
was not his.</p>

<p>“Oh, little boy,” he said, rubbing his eyes and
springing to his feet, “what a wicked, wicked little
boy you are! You have been snaring a pheasant!”</p>

<p>The small boy, who was about his age, looked
frightened and penitent: he saw his accuser was a little
gentleman.</p>

<p>“Please, sir, don’t tell on me,” he said, with a
whimper. “I’ll gie ye the bird if ye won’t tell on
me.”</p>

<p>“I do not want the bird,” said Bertie, with magisterial
gravity. “You are a wicked little boy to offer
it to me. It is not your own, and you have killed it.
You are a <i>thief!</i>”</p>

<p>“Please, sir,” whimpered the little poacher, “dad
allus tooked ’em like this.”</p>

<p>“Then he is a thief too,” said Bertie.</p>

<p>“He was a good un to me,” said the small boy, and
then fairly burst out sobbing. “He was a good un to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
me, and he’s dead a year come Lady-day, and mother
she’s main bad, and little Susie’s got the croup, and
there’s nowt to eat to home; and I hear Susie cryin’,
cryin’, cryin’, and so I gae to cupboard where dad’s
old tackle be kep, and I gits out this here, and says I
to myself, maybe I’ll git one of them birds i’ spinney,
’cos they make rare broth, and we had a many on ’em
when dad was alive, and Towser.”</p>

<p>“Who was Towser?”</p>

<p>“He was our lurcher; keeper shot him; he’d bring
of ’em in his mouth like a Chrisen; and gin ye’ll tell
on me, they’ll clap me in prison like they did dad, and
it’s birch rods they’d give yer, and mother’s nowt but
me.”</p>

<p>“I do not know who owns this property,” said Bertie,
in his little sedate way, “so I could not tell the
owner, and I should not wish to do it if I could; but
still it is a very wicked thing to snare birds at all, and
when they are game-birds it is <i>robbery</i>.”</p>

<p>“I know as how they makes it so,” demurred the
poacher’s son. “But dad said as how——”</p>

<p>“No one makes it so,” said Bertie, with a little
righteous anger; “it <i>is</i> so: the birds are not yours,
and so, if you take them, you are a thief.”</p>

<p>The boy put his thumb in his mouth and dangled
his dead pheasant.</p>

<p>A discussion on the game-laws was beyond his powers,
nor was even Bertie conscious of the mighty subject
he was opening, though the instincts of the land-owner
were naturally in him, and it seemed to him so
shocking to find a boy with such views as this as to
<i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>, that he almost fancied the sun would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
fall from the sky. The sun, however, glowed on, low
down in the wood beyond a belt of firs, and the green
downs, and the gray sea; and the little sinner stood
before him, fascinated by his appearance and frightened
at his words.</p>

<p>“Do you know who owns this coppice?” asked Bertie;
and the boy answered him, reluctantly,—</p>

<p>“Yes: Sir Henry.”</p>

<p>“Then, what you must do,” said Bertie, “is to go
directly with that bird to Sir Henry, and beg his pardon,
and ask him to forgive you. Go at once. That
is what you must do.”</p>

<p>The boy opened eyes and mouth in amaze.</p>

<p>“That I won’t never do,” he said, doggedly: “I’d
be took up to the lodge afore I’d open my mouth.”</p>

<p>“Not if I go with you,” said Bertie.</p>

<p>“Be you one of the fam’ly, sir?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Bertie, and then was silent in some confusion,
for he bethought him that, without any shoes
on, he might also be arrested at the lodge gates.</p>

<p>“I thought as not, ’cos you’re barefoot,” said the
brown-cheeked boy, with a little contempt supplying
the place of courage. “Dunno who you be, sir, but
seems to I as you’ve no call to preach to me: you be
a-trespassin’ too.”</p>

<p>Bertie colored.</p>

<p>“I am not doing any harm,” he said, with dignity;
“you are: you have been stealing. If you are not really
a wicked boy, you will take the pheasant straight to
that gentleman, and beg him to forgive you, and I
dare say he will give you work.”</p>

<p>“There’s no work for my dad’s son,” said the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
poacher, half sadly, half sullenly: “the keepers are all
agen us: ’tis as much as mother and me and Susie can
do to git a bit o’ bread.”</p>

<p>“What work can you do?”</p>

<p>“I can make the gins,” said the little sinner, touching
the trap with pride. “Mostwhiles, I never comes
out o’ daylight; but all the forenoon Susie was going
off her head, want o’ summat t’ eat.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for Susie and you,” said the little Earl,
with sympathy. “But indeed, indeed, nothing can excuse
a theft, or make God——”</p>

<p>“The keepers!” yelled the boy, with a scream like
a hare’s, and he dashed head-foremost into the bushes,
casting on to Bertie’s lap the gin and the dead bird.
Bertie was so surprised that he sat perfectly mute and
still: the little boy had disappeared as fast as a rabbit
bolts at sight of a ferret. Two grim big men with
dogs and guns burst through the hawthorn, and one
of them seized the little Earl with no gentle hand.</p>

<p>“You little blackguard! you’ll smart for this,” yelled
the big man. “Treadmill and birch rod, or I’m a
Dutchman.”</p>

<p>Bertie was so surprised, still, that he was silent.
Then, with his little air of innocent majesty, he said,
simply, “You are mistaken: I did not kill the bird.”</p>

<p>Now, if Bertie had had his usual nicety of apparel,
or if the keeper had not been in a fuming fury, the
latter would have easily seen that he had accused and
apprehended a little gentleman. But no one in a violent
rage ever has much sense or sight left to aid him,
and Big George, as this keeper was called, did not
notice that his dogs were smelling in a friendly way at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
his prisoner, but only saw that he had to do with a
pale-faced lad without shoes, and very untidy and
dusty-looking, who had snares and a snared pheasant
at his feet.</p>

<p>Before Bertie had even seen him take a bit of cord
out of his pocket, he had tied the little Earl’s hands
behind him, picked up the pheasant and the trap,
and given some directions to his companion. The
real culprit was already a quarter of a mile off, burrowing
safely in the earth of an old fox killed in
February,—a hiding-place with which he was very
familiar.</p>

<p>Bertie, meanwhile, was quite silent. He was thinking
to himself, “If I tell them another boy did it, they
will go and look for him, and catch him, and put him
in prison; and then his mother and Susie will be so
miserable,—more miserable than ever. I think I
ought to keep quiet. Jesus never said anything when
they buffeted him.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you little gallows-bird, you’ll get it this time!”
said the keeper, knotting the string tighter about his
wrists, and speaking as if he had had the little Earl
very often in such custody.</p>

<p>“You are a very rude man,” said Bertie, with the
angry color in his cheeks; but Big George heeded him
not, being engaged in swearing at one of his dogs,—a
young one, who was trotting after a rabbit.</p>

<p>“I know who this youngster is, Bob,” he said to his
companion: “he’s the Radley shaver over from Blackgang.”</p>

<p>Bertie wondered who the Radley shaver was that
resembled him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“He has the looks on him,” said the other, prudently.</p>

<p>“Sir Henry’s dining at Chigwell to-night, and he’ll
have started afore we get there,” continued Big George.
“Go you on through spinney far as Edge Pool, and
I’ll take and lock this here Radley up till morning.
Blast his impudence,—a pheasant! think of the likes
of it! A pheasant! If ’t had been a rabbit, ’t had
been bad enough.”</p>

<p>Then he shook his little captive vigorously.</p>

<p>Bertie did not say anything. He was not in trepidation
for himself, but he was in an agony of fear lest
the other boy should be found in the spinney.</p>

<p>“March along afore me,” said Big George, with
much savageness. “And if you tries to bolt, I’ll blow
your brains out and nail you to a barn-door along o’
the owls.”</p>

<p>The little Earl looked at him with eyes of scorn and
horror.</p>

<p>“How dare you touch Athene’s bird?”</p>

<p>“How dare I what, you little saucy blackguard?”
thundered Big George, and fetched him a great box on
the ears which made Bertie stagger.</p>

<p>“You are a very bad man,” he said, breathlessly.
“You are a very mean man. You are big, and so you
are cruel: that is very mean indeed.”</p>

<p>“You’ve the gift of the gab, little devil of a Radley,”
said the keeper, wrathfully; “but you’ll pipe
another tune when you feel the birch and pick oakum.”</p>

<p>Bertie set his teeth tight to keep his words in: he
walked on mute.</p>

<p>“You’ve stole some little gemman’s togs as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
as my pheasant,” said Big George, surveying him.
“Why didn’t you steal a pair of boots when you was
about it?”</p>

<p>Bertie was still mute.</p>

<p>“I will not say anything to this bad man,” he
thought, “or else he will find out that it was not I.”</p>

<p>The sun had set by this time, leaving only a silvery
light above the sea and the downs: the pale
long twilight of an English day had come upon the
earth.</p>

<p>Bertie was very white, and his heart beat fast, and
he was growing very hungry; but he managed to stumble
on, though very painfully, for his courage would
not let him repine before this savage man, who was
mixed up in his mind with Bluebeard, and Thor, and
Croquemitaine, and Richard III., and Nero, and all
the ogres that he had ever met with in his reading,
and who seemed to grow larger and larger and larger
as the sky and earth grew darker.</p>

<p>Happily for his shoeless feet, the way lay all over
grass-lands and mossy paths; but he limped so that
the keeper swore at him many times, and the little
Earl felt the desperate resignation of the martyr.</p>

<p>At last they came in sight of the keeper’s cottage,
standing on the edge of the preserves,—a thatched and
gabled little building, with a light glimmering in its
lattice window.</p>

<p>At the sound of Big George’s heavy tread, a woman
and some children ran out.</p>

<p>“Lord ha’ mercy! George!” cried the wife. “What
scarecrow have you been and got?”</p>

<p>“A Radley boy,” growled George,—“one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
cussed Radley boys at last,—and a pheasant snared
took in his very hand!”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it!” cried his wife; and the small
children yelled and jumped. “What’ll be done with
him, dad?” cried the eldest of them.</p>

<p>“I’ll put him in fowl-house to-night,” said Big
George, “and up he’ll go afore Sir Henry fust thing
to-morrow. Clear off, young uns, and let me run him
in.”</p>

<p>Bertie looked up in Big George’s face.</p>

<p>“I had nothing to do with killing the bird,” he said,
in a firm though a faint voice. “You quite mistake.
I am Lord Avillion.”</p>

<p>“Stop your pipe, or I’ll choke yer,” swore Big
George, enraged by what he termed the “darned
cheek” of a Radley boy; and without more ado he
laid hold of the little Earl’s collar and lifted him into
the fowl-house, the door of which was held open
eagerly by his eldest girl.</p>

<p>There was a great flapping of wings, screeching of
hens, and piping of chicks at the interruption, where
all the inmates were gone to roost, and one cock set up
his usual salutation to the dawn.</p>

<p>“That’s better nor you’ll sleep to-morrow night,”
said Big George, as he tumbled Bertie on to a truss
of straw that lay there, when he went out himself,
slammed the door, and both locked and barred it on
the outside.</p>

<p>Bertie fell back on the straw, sobbing bitterly: his
feet were cut and bleeding, his whole body ached like
one great bruise, and he was sick and faint with hunger.
“If the world be as difficult as this to live in,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
he thought, “how ever do some people manage to live
almost to a hundred years in it?” and to his eight-year-old
little soul the prospect of a long life seemed so horrible
that he sobbed again at the very thought of it. It
was quite dark in the fowl-house; the rustling and
fluttering of the poultry all around sounded mysterious
and unearthly; the strong, unpleasant smell made
him faint, and the pain in his feet grew greater every
moment. He did not scream or go into convulsions;
he was a brave little man, and proud; but he felt as
if the long, lonely night there would kill him.</p>

<p>Half an hour, perhaps, had gone by when a woman’s
voice at the little square window said, softly, “Here
is bread and water for you, poor boy; and I’ve put
some milk and cheese, too, only my man mustn’t know
it.”</p>

<p>Bertie with great effort raised himself, and took what
was pushed through the tiny window; a mug of milk
being lowered to him last by a large red fat hand,
on which the light of a candle held without was glowing.</p>

<p>“Thanks very much,” said the little Earl, feebly.
“But, madam, I did not kill that bird, and indeed I
am Lord Avillion.”</p>

<p>The good woman went within to her lord, and said
timidly to him, “George, are you sartin sure that there’s
a Radley boy? He do look and speak like a little
gemman, and he do say as how he is one.”</p>

<p>Big George called her bad names.</p>

<p>“A barefoot gemman!” he said, with a sneer. “You
thunderin’ fool! it’s weazened-faced Vic Radley, as
have been in our woods a hundred times if wunce,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
though never could I slap eyes on him quick enough
to pin him.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 431px;">
<img src="images/i-239.jpg" width="431" height="600" alt="Earl sharing food with puppy" />
<div class="caption">HE SHARED IT WILLINGLY</div>
</div>

<p>The good housewife took up her stocking-mending
and said no more. Big George’s arguments were
sometimes enforced with the fist, and even with the
pewter pot or the poker.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the little Earl in the hen-house was so
hungry that he drank the milk and ate the bread and
cheese. Both were harder and rougher things than
any he had ever tasted; but he had now that hunger
which had made the boy on the stile relish the turnip,
and, besides, another incident had occurred to give him
relish for the food.</p>

<p>At the moment when he had sat down to drink the
milk, there had tumbled out from behind the straw a
round black-and-white object, unsteady on its legs, and
having a very broad nose and a very woolly coat. The
moon had risen by this time, and was shining in through
the little square window, and by its beams Bertie could
see this thing was a puppy,—a Newfoundland puppy
some four months old. He welcomed it with as much
rapture as ever Robert Bruce did the spider. It had
evidently been awakened from its sleep by the smell of
the food. It was a pleasant, companionable, warm and
kindly creature; it knocked the bread out of his hand,
and thrust its square mouth into his milk, but he shared
it willingly, and had a hearty cry over it that did him
good.</p>

<p>He did not feel all alone, now that this blundering,
toppling, shapeless, amiable baby-dog had found its
way to him. He caressed it in his arms and kissed it
a great many times, and it responded much more gratefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
than the human baby had done in Jim Bracken’s
cottage, and finally, despite his bleeding feet and his
tired limbs, he fell asleep with his face against the pup’s
woolly body.</p>

<p>When he awoke, he could not remember what had
happened. He called for Deborah, but no Deborah
was there. The moon, now full, was shining still
through the queer little dusky place; the figures of the
fowls, rolled up in balls of feathers and stuck upon
one leg, were all that met his straining eyes. He pulled
the puppy closer and closer to him: for the first time
in his life he felt really frightened.</p>

<p>“I never touched the pheasant,” he cried, as loud as
he could. “I am Lord Avillion! You have no right
to keep me here. Let me out! let me out! let me
out!”</p>

<p>The fowls woke up, and then cried and cackled and
crowed, and the poor pup whined and yelped dolefully,
but he got no other answer. Everybody in Big George’s
cottage was asleep, except Big George himself, who,
with his revolver, his fowling-piece, and a couple of
bull-dogs, was gone out again into the woods.</p>

<p>At home, Bertie in his pretty bed, that had belonged
to the little Roi de Rome, had always had a soft light
burning in a porcelain shade, and his nurse within easy
call, and Ralph on the mat by the door. He had
never been in the dark before, and he could hear
unseen things moving and rustling in the straw, and
he felt afraid of the white moonbeams shifting hither
and thither and shining on the shape of the big Brahma
cock till the great bird looked like a vulture. Once a
rat ran swiftly across, and then the fowls shrieked, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Bertie could not help screaming with them; but in a
minute or two he felt ashamed of himself, for he thought,
“A rat is God’s creature as much as I am; and, as I
have not done anything wrong, I do not think they
will be allowed to hurt me.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the night was very terrible. Without
the presence of the puppy, no doubt, the little Earl
would have frightened himself into convulsions and
delirium; but the pup was so comforting to him, so
natural, so positively a thing real and in no wise of
the outer world, that Bertie kept down, though with
many a sob, the panics of unreasoning terror which
assailed him as the moon sailed away past the square
loop-hole, and a great darkness seemed to wrap him up
in it as though some giant were stifling him in a magic
cloak.</p>

<p>The pup had not long been taken from its mother,
and had been teased all day by the keeper’s children,
and was frightened, and whimpered a good deal, and
cuddled itself close to the little Earl, who hugged it
and kissed it in paroxysms of loneliness and longing
for comfort.</p>

<p>With these long, horrible black hours, all sorts of
notions and terrors assailed him; all he had ever read
of dungeons, of enchanted castles, of entrapped princes,
of Prince Arthur and the Duke of Rothsay, of the
prisoner of Chillon and the Iron Mask, of every kind
of hero, martyr, and wizard-bewitched captive, crowded
into his mind with horrifying clearness, thronging on
him with a host of fearful images and memories.</p>

<p>But this was only in his weaker moments. When
he clasped the puppy and felt its warm wet tongue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
lick his hair, he gathered up his courage: after all, he
thought, Big George was certainly only a keeper,—not
an ogre, or an astrologer, or a tyrant of Athens or of
Rome.</p>

<p>So he fell off again, after a long and dreadful waking-time,
into a fitful slumber, in which his feet ached and
his nerves jumped, and the frightful visions assailed
him just as much as when he was awake; and how
that ghastly night passed by him, he never knew very
well.</p>

<p>When he again opened his eyes there was a dim gray
light in the fowl-house, and sharp in his ear was ringing
the good-morrow of the Brahma chanticleer.</p>

<p>It was daybreak.</p>

<p>A round red face looked in at the square hole, and
the voice of the keeper’s wife said, “Little gemman,
Big George will be arter ye come eight o’clock, and
’t ’ll go hard wi’ yer. Say now, yer didn’t snare the
bird?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Bertie, languidly, lying full length on
the straw; he felt shivery and chilly, and very stiff
and very miserable in all ways.</p>

<p>“But yer know who did!” persisted the woman.
“Now, jist you tell me, and I’ll make it all square
with George, and he’ll let you out, and we’ll gie ye
porridge, and we’ll take ye home on the donkey.”</p>

<p>The little Earl was silent.</p>

<p>“Now, drat ye for a obstinate! I can’t abide a
obstinate,” said the woman, angrily. “Who did snare
the bird? jist say that; ’tis all, and mighty little.”</p>

<p>“I will not say that,” said Bertie; and the woman
slammed a wooden door that there was to the loop-hole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and told him he was a mule and a pig, and that
she was not going to waste any more words about him;
she should let the birds out by the bars. What she
called the bars, which were two movable lengths of
wood at the bottom of one of the walls, did in point
of fact soon slip aside, and the fowls all cackled and
strutted and fluttered after their different manners, and
bustled through the opening towards the daylight and
the scattered corn, the Brahma cock having much ado
to squeeze his plumage where his wives had passed.</p>

<p>“The puppy’s hungry,” said Bertie, timidly.</p>

<p>“Drat the puppy!” said the woman outside; and
no more compassion was wrung out of her. The little
Earl felt very languid, light-headed, and strange; he
was faint, and a little feverish.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, pup! what a night!” he murmured, with
a burst of sobbing.</p>

<p>Yet it never occurred to him to purchase his liberty
by giving up little guilty Dan.</p>

<p>Some more hours rolled on,—slow, empty, desolate,—filled
with the whine of the pup for its mother, and
the chirping of unseen martins going in and out of the
roof above-head.</p>

<p>“I suppose they mean to starve me to death,”
thought Bertie, his thoughts clinging to the Duke of
Rothsay’s story.</p>

<p>He heard the tread of Big George on the ground
outside, and his deep voice cursing and swearing, and
the children running to and fro, and the hens cackling.
Then the little Earl remembered that he was born of
brave men, and must not be unworthy of them; and
he rose, though unsteadily, and tried to pull his disordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
dress together, and tried, too, not to look
afraid.</p>

<p>He recalled Casabianca on the burning ship: Casabianca
had not been so very much older than he.</p>

<p>The door was thrust open violently, and that big
grim black man looked in. “Come, varmint!” he
cried out; “come out and get your merits: birch and
bread-and-water and Scripture-readin’ for a good month,
I’ll go bail; and ’t ’ud be a year if I wur the beak.”</p>

<p>Then Bertie, on his little shaky shivering limbs,
walked quite haughtily towards him and the open air,
the puppy waddling after him. “You should not be
so very rough and rude,” he said: “I will go with you.
But the puppy wants some milk.”</p>

<p>Big George’s only answer was to clutch wildly at
Bertie’s clothes and hurl him anyhow, head first, into
a little pony-cart that stood ready. “Such tarnation
cheek I never seed,” he swore; “but all them Radley
imps are as like one to t’ other as so many ribston-pippins,—all
the gift o’ the gab and tallow-faces!”</p>

<p>Bertie, lying very sick and dizzy in the bottom of
the cart, managed to find breath to call out to the
woman on the door-step, “Please do give the puppy
something; it has been so hungry all night.”</p>

<p>“That’s no Radley boy,” said the keeper’s wife to
her eldest girl as the cart drove away. “Only a little
gemman ’ud ha’ thought of the pup. Strikes me, lass,
your daddy’s put a rod in pickle for hisself along o’
his tantrums and tivies.”</p>

<p>It was but a mile and a half from the keeper’s cottage
to the mansion of the Sir Henry who was owner
of these lands; and the pony spun along at a swing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
trot, and Big George, smoking and rattling along,
never deigned to look at his prisoner.</p>

<p>“Another poachin’ boy, Mr. Mason?” said the woman
who opened the lodge gates; and Big George answered,
heartily,—</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, a Radley imp caught at last. Got the bird
on him, and the gin too. What d’ye call that?”</p>

<p>“I call it like your vigilance, Mr. Mason,” said the
lodge-keeper. “But, lawks! he do look a mite!”</p>

<p>Big George spun on up the avenue with the air of a
man who knew his own important place in the world,
and the little cart was soon pulled up at the steps of a
stately Italian-like building.</p>

<p>“See Sir Henry to wunce: poachin’ case,” said Big
George to the footman lounging about the doorway.</p>

<p>“Of course, Mr. Mason. Sir Henry said as you was
to go to him directly.”</p>

<p>“Step this way,” said one of the men; and Big
George proceeded to haul Bertie out of the cart as unceremoniously
as he had thrown him in; but the little
Earl, although his head spun and his shoeless feet
ached, managed to get down himself, and staggered
across the hall.</p>

<p>“A Radley boy!” said Big George, displaying him
with much pride. “All the spring and all the winter
I’ve been after that weazen-faced varmint, and now
I’ve <i>got</i> him.”</p>

<p>“Sir Henry waits,” said a functionary; and Big
George marched into a handsome library, dragging
his captive behind him, towards the central writing-table,
at which a good-looking elderly gentleman was
sitting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Arrived before his master, the demeanor of Big
George underwent a remarkable change; he cringed,
and he pulled his lock of hair, and he scraped about
with his leg in the humblest manner possible, and
proceeded to lay the dead pheasant and the trap and
gear upon the table.</p>

<p>“Took him in the ac’, Sir Henry,” he said, with
triumph piercing through deference. “I been after
him ages; he’s a Radley boy, the little gallows-bird;
he’s been snarin’ and dodgin’ and stealin’ all the winter
long, and here we’ve got him.”</p>

<p>“He is very small,—quite a child,” said Sir Henry,
doubtingly, trying to see the culprit.</p>

<p>“He’s stunted in his growth along o’ wickedness,
sir,” said Big George, very positively; “but he’s old
in wice; that’s what he is, sir,—old in wice.”</p>

<p>At that moment Bertie managed to get in front of
him, and lifted his little faint voice.</p>

<p>“He has made a mistake,” he said, feebly: “I never
killed your birds at all, and I am Lord Avillion.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens! you thundering idiot!” shouted
Sir Henry, springing to his feet. “This is the little
Earl they are looking for all over the island, and all
over the country! My dear little fellow, how can I
ever——”</p>

<p>His apologies were cut short by Bertie dropping
down in a dead faint at his feet, so weak was he from
cold, and hunger, and exhaustion, and unwonted exposure.</p>

<p>It was not very long, however, before all the alarmed
household, pouring in at the furious ringing of their
master’s bell, had revived the little Earl, and brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
him to his senses none the worse for the momentary
eclipse of them.</p>

<p>“Please do not be angry with your man,” murmured
Bertie, as he lay on one of the wide leathern couches.
“He meant to do his duty; and please—will you let
me buy the puppy?”</p>

<p>Of course Sir Henry would not allow the little Earl
to wander any farther afield, and of course a horseman
was sent over in hot haste to apprise his people, misled
by the boat-lad, who, frightened at his own share in
the little gentleman’s escape, had sworn till he was
hoarse that he had seen Lord Avillion take a boat for
Rye.</p>

<p>So Bertie’s liberty was nipped in the bud, and very
sorrowfully and wistfully he strayed out on to the rose-terrace
of Sir Henry’s house, awaiting the coming of
his friends. The puppy had been fetched, and was
tumbling and waddling solemnly beside him; yet he
was very sad at heart.</p>

<p>“What are you thinking of, my child?” said Sir
Henry, who was a gentle and learned man.</p>

<p>Bertie’s mouth quivered.</p>

<p>“I see,” he said, hesitatingly,—“I see <i>I</i> am nothing.
It is the title they give me, and the money I have got,
that make the people so good to me. When I am only
<i>me</i>, you see how it is.”</p>

<p>And the tears rolled down his face, which he had
heard called “wizen” and “puny” and likened to
tallow.</p>

<p>“My dear little fellow,” said his grown-up companion,
tenderly, “there comes a day when even kings
are stripped of all their pomp, and lie naked and stark;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
it is then that which they have done, not that which
they have been, that will find them grace and let them
rise again.”</p>

<p>“But I am nothing!” said Bertie, piteously. “You
see, when the people do not know who I am, they
think me nothing at all.”</p>

<p>“I don’t fancy Peggy and Dan will think so when
we tell them everything,” said the host. “We are all
of us nothing in ourselves, my child; only, here and
there we pluck a bit of lavender,—that is, we do some
good thing or say some kind word,—and then we get
a sweet savor from it. You will gather a great deal
of lavender in your life, or I am mistaken.”</p>

<p>“I will try,” said Bertie, who understood.</p>

<p>So, off the downs that day, and in the pleasant hawthorn
woods of the friendly little Isle, he plucked two
heads of lavender,—humility and sympathy. Believe
me, they are worth as much as was the moly of Ulysses.</p>
